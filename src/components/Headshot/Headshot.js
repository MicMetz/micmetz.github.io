					I am a perpetual student. As of right now, I'm studying computer science at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder).
					Before, and not too long ago, I was studying how groups interact and how human social relationships form as a
					Sociology and Information Science focused student at multiple New York universities over a few years. Next, who knows?
					I'm open to anything, and never satisfied with just sitting idle, Iâ€™m always scouring for something.
