														My name is Michael Metz, and as of right now, I would consider myself, a perpetual
														learner. Or, if the last few years are any indication, a more accurately status I
														could ascribe myself would be as a perpetual
														student.

														<br />
														<br />

														For the last few years, I've been studying computer science at the University of
														Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder).

														<br />
														<br />

														Not too long ago, I was studying how groups interact and how human social
														relationships form as a Sociology and Information Science focused student at
														multiple New York universities, and colleges, for both my
														undergraduate degrees,
														associate's degrees, and certificates.

														<br />
														<br />

														Next, who knows? I'm open to anything, and never satisfied with just sitting idle,
														Iâ€™m always scouring for something.

																		For about a year now, I've been developing a steady addiction to 3D graphics, and game
																		development.
																</p >
																<br />
																<p >
																		So far I've explored a few different libraries, and frameworks. And I've used almost
																		every single one of the most popular engines from Unity and Unreal, to Godot and
																		Lumberyard. But so far, I've found that the best
																		fit
																		for me has
																		been <Link href = "https://threejs.org/" >THREE.js</Link >, the <Link
																		href = "https://www.babylonjs.com/"
																>BabylonJS</Link > framework, and a focus on web
																		development.
