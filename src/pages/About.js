            My name is Michael Metz, and as of right now, I would consider myself, a perpetual
            learner. Or, if the last few years are any indication, a more accurately status I
            could ascribe myself would be as a perpetual
            student.

            For the last few years, I've been studying computer science at the University of
            Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder).

            Not too long ago, I was studying how groups interact and how human social
            relationships form as a Sociology and Information Science focused student at
            multiple New York universities, and colleges, for both my
            undergraduate degrees, associate's degrees, and certificates.

            Next, who knows? I'm open to anything, and never satisfied with just sitting idle,
            Iâ€™m always scouring for something.

            For about a year now, I've been developing a steady addiction to 3D graphics, and game
            development.
            <Spacer />
            So far I've explored a few different libraries, and frameworks. And I've used almost
            every single one of the most popular engines from Unity and Unreal, to Godot and
            Lumberyard. But so far, I've found that the best fit for me has been{' '}

            development.
