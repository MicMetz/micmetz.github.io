If they reveal themselves, they risk being attacked by automated predators.\n\nHumans who want to engage in informal, unoptimised, personal interactions have to hide in closed spaces like invite-only Slack channels, Discord groups, email newsletters, small-scale blogs, and [[digital gardens]]. Or make themselves [illegible](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/) and algorithmically incoherent in public venues.\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  alt=\"An illustration of layers of the web: the dark forest on top, followed by layers of cozyweb holes where people hide away from bots and ad scavengers\"\n  src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/cozyweb.png\"\n/>\n\nThat dark forest is about to <div style={{transform: \"scaleX(1.85)\", display: \"inline-flex\", margin: \"0 2.2rem\"}}>expand</div>. Large Language Models (LLMs) that can instantly generate coherent swaths of human-like text have just joined the party.\n\nOver the last six months, we've seen a flood of LLM copywriting and content-generation products come out: [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/), [Moonbeam](https://www.gomoonbeam.com/), [Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/), and [Anyword](https://anyword.com/) are just a few. They're designed to pump out advertising copy, blog posts, emails, social media updates, and marketing pages. And they're _really_ good at it.<Footnote idName={2}>Primarily because [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) which powers many of these products was specifically trained on text from the web. It's intimately familiar with the style of language we use online.</Footnote>\n\nThese models became competent copywriters much faster than people expected ‚Äì too fast for us to fully process the implications. Many people had their come-to-Jesus moment a few weeks ago when OpenAI released [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), a slightly more capable version of GPT-3 with an accessible chat-bot style interface. <Footnote idName={3}>They're calling it GPT-3.5. It's the same model with human [reinforcement learning](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) layered on top.</Footnote> The [collective](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1599128577068650498?s=20&t=MgaSdgsaF0uU1lITCVPghw) [shock](https://twitter.com/volodarik/status/1600854935515844610?s=20&t=MgaSdgsaF0uU1lITCVPghw) and [awe](https://twitter.com/yu_angela/status/1599808692085743616?s=20&t=MgaSdgsaF0uU1lITCVPghw) [reaction](https://twitter.com/levie/status/1599156293050433536?s=20&t=MgaSdgsaF0uU1lITCVPghw) made clear how few people had been tracking the progress of these models.\n\nTo complicate matters, language models are not the only mimicry machines gathering speed right now. Image generators like [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=/app/), [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), and [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) have been on a year-long sprint. In January they could barely render a low-resolution, disfigured human face. By the autumn they reliably produced images indistinguishable from the work of human photographers and illustrators.\n\n<TwoColumn maxWidth=\"1100px\">\n\n<ResponsiveImage src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/mj8.png\" alt=\"...\" />\n\n<ResponsiveImage src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/mj1.png\" alt=\"...\" />\n\n<ResponsiveImage src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/mj7.png\" alt=\"...\" />\n\n<ResponsiveImage src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/mj3.png\" alt=\"...\" />\n\n<ResponsiveImage src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/mj9.png\" alt=\"...\" />\n\n<ResponsiveImage src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/mj4.png\" alt=\"...\" />\n\n</TwoColumn>\n\n<Subtext>Images I generated with Midjourney's V4 model</Subtext>\n\n## A Generated Web\n\nThere's a swirl of optimism around how these models will save us from a suite of boring busywork: writing formal emails, internal memos, technical documentation, marketing copy, product announcement, advertisements, cover letters, and even negotiating with medical [insurance companies](https://twitter.com/StuartBlitz/status/1602834224284897282).\n\nBut we'll also need to reckon with the trade-offs of making insta-paragraphs and 1-click cover images. These new models are poised to flood the web with generic, generated content.\n\nYou thought the first page of Google was bunk before? You haven't seen Google where SEO optimizer bros pump out billions of perfectly coherent but predictably dull informational articles for every longtail keyword combination under the sun.\n\nMarketers, influencers, and growth hackers will set up [OpenAI ‚Üí Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/openai/integrations) pipelines that auto-publish a relentless and impossibly banal stream of LinkedIn #MotivationMonday posts, ‚Äúengaging‚Äù tweet <span role=\"img\">üßµ</span> threads, Facebook outrage monologues, and corporate blog posts.\n\nIt goes beyond text too: [video essays on YouTube](https://twitter.com/SamRo/status/1605919856808714240?s=20&t=QB-eYoISuymlqbHFFDnrWw), TikTok clips, podcasts, slide decks, and Instagram stories can all be generated by [patchworking](https://runwayml.com/) together ML systems. And then [regurgitated](https://byautomata.io/) for each medium.\n\nWe're about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. Goodbye to finding original human insights or authentic connections under that pile of cruft.\n\nMany people will say we already live in this reality. We've already become skilled at sifting through unhelpful piles of ‚Äúoptimised content‚Äù designed to gather clicks and advertising impressions.\n\n4chan proposed [dead internet theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/) years ago: that most of the internet is ‚Äúempty and devoid of people‚Äù and has been taken over by artificial intelligence. A milder version of this theory is simply that we're overrun [with bots](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html). Most of us take that for granted at this point.\n\nBut I think the sheer volume and scale of what's coming will be meaningfully different. And I think we're unprepared. Or at least, I am.\n\n---\n\n## Passing the Reverse Turing Test\n\nOur new challenge as little snowflake humans will be to prove we aren't language models. It's the reverse [turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"1601541418153304064\" />\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"1601750189974245377\" />\n\nAfter the forest expands, we will become deeply sceptical of one another's _realness_. Every time you find a new favourite blog or Twitter account or Tiktok personality online, you'll have to ask: Is this really a whole human with a rich and complex life like mine? Is there a _being_ on the other end of this web interface I can form a relationship with?<Footnote idName={4}>‚ÄúRelationship‚Äù in the holistic sense ‚Äì friend, acquaintance, pen pal, intellectual interlocutor, frenemy, drinking buddy, and sure, maybe a lover.</Footnote>\n\nBefore you continue, pause and consider: How would _you_ prove you're not a language model generating predictive text? What special human tricks can you do that a language model can't?\n\n### 1. Triangulate objective reality\n\nAs language models become increasingly capable and impressive, we should remember they are, at their core, linguistic [prediction systems](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-gpt-3#:~:text=Language%20modeling%20is,predicting%20word%20sequences.). They cannot (yet) reason like a human.\n\nThey do not have beliefs based on evidence, claims, and principles. They cannot consult external sources and run experiments against objective reality. They cannot go outside and touch grass.\n\nIn short, they do not have access to the same shared reality we do. They do not have embodied experiences, and cannot sense the world as we can sense it; they don't have vision, sound, taste, or touch. They cannot feel emotion or tightly hold a coherent set of values. They are not part of cultures, communities, or histories.\n\nThey are a language model in a box. If a historical event, fact, person, or concept wasn't part of their training data, they can't tell you about it. They don't know about events that happened after a certain cutoff date. <Footnote idName={5}>Currently 2021 for GPT-3 / ChatGPT, but we can expect that to regularly update as new models are trained</Footnote>\n\nI found Murray Shanahan's paper on [Talking About Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551) (2022) full of helpful reflections on this point:\n\n<BlockquoteCitation author=\"Murray Shanahan\" title=\"Talking About Large Language Models\" url=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551\">\n\nHumans are members of a community of language-users inhabiting a shared world, and this primal fact makes them essentially different to large language models. We can consult the world to settle our disagreements and update our beliefs. We can, so to speak, ‚Äútriangulate‚Äù on objective reality.\n\n</BlockquoteCitation>\n\nThis leaves us with some low-hanging fruit for humanness. We can tell richly detailed stories grounded in our specific contexts and cultures: place names, sensual descriptions, local knowledge, and, well the _je ne sais quoi_ of being alive. Language models can decently mimic this style of writing but most don't without extensive prompt engineering. They stick to generics. They hedge. They leave out details. They have trouble maintaining a coherent sense of self over thousands of words.\n\nHipsterism and recency bias will help us here. Referencing obscure concepts, friends who are real but not famous, niche interests, and recent events all make you plausibly more human.<Footnote idName={6}>This feels eerily like a hostage holding up yesterday's newspaper to prove they are actively in danger. Perhaps a premonition.</Footnote>\n\n### 2. Be original, critical, and sophisticated\n\nEasier said than done, but one of the best ways to prove you're not a predictive language model is to demonstrate critical and sophisticated thinking.\n\nLanguage models spit out text that sounds like a B+ college essay. Coherent, seemingly comprehensive, but never truly insightful or original (at least for now).\n\nIn a repulsively evocative metaphor, they engage in ‚Äú[human centipede](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Centipede_(First_Sequence)>) epistemology.‚Äù<Footnote idName={7}>I found this phrase via Twitter, but posted from a private account so I won't cite the original author.</Footnote> Language models regurgitate text from across the web, which some humans read and recycle into \"original creations,\" which then become fodder to train other language models, and around and around we go recycling generic ideas and arguments and tropes and ways of thinking.\n\nHard exiting out of this cycle requires coming up with unquestionably original thoughts and theories. It means seeing and synthesising patterns across a broad range of sources: books, blogs, cultural narratives served up by media outlets, conversations, podcasts, lived experiences, and market trends. We can observe and analyse a much fuller range of inputs than bots and generative models can.\n\nIt will raise the stakes for everyone. As both consumers of content and creators of it, we'll have to foster a greater sense of critical thinking and scepticism.\n\nThis all sounds a bit rough, but there's a lot of hope in this vision. In a world of automated intelligence, our goalposts for intelligence will shift. We'll raise our quality bar for what we expect from humans. When a machine can pump out a great literature review or summary of existing work, there's no value in a person doing it.\n\n### 3. Develop creative language quirks, dialects, memes, and jargon\n\nThe linguist [Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure) argued there are two kinds of language:\n\n- **La langue** is the formal concept of language. These are words we print in the dictionary, distribute via educational institutions, and reprimand one another for getting it wrong.\n- **La parole** is the speech of everyday life. These are the informal, diverse, and creative speech acts we perform in conversations, social gatherings, and text to the group WhatsApp. This is where language evolves.\n\nWe have designed a system that automates a standardised way of writing. We have codified _la langue_ at a specific point in time.\n\nWhat we have left to play with is _la parole_. No language model will be able to keep up with the pace of weird internet lingo and memes. I expect we'll lean into this. Using neologisms, jargon, euphemistic emoji, unusual phrases, ingroup dialects, and memes-of-the-moment will help signal your humanity.\n\nNot unlike teenagers using language to subvert their elders, or oppressed communities developing dialects that allow them to safely communicate amongst themselves.\n\n### 4. Consider institutional verification\n\nThis solution feels the least interesting. We're already hearing rumblings of how ‚Äúverification‚Äù by centralised institutions or companies might help us distinguish between meat brains and metal brains.\n\nThe idea is something like this: you show up in person to register your online accounts or domains. You then get some kind of special badge or mark online legitimising you as a Real Human. It may or may not be on the blockchain somehow.\n\nGoogle might look something like this:\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  framed\n  src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/human_google.jpg\"\n  width=\"1300px\"\n  alt=\"Google search results showing a 'certified human' badge on some items\"\n/>\n\nThe whole thing seems fraught with problems, susceptible to abuse, and ultimately impractical. Would it even be the web if everyone knew you were really a dog?\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  src=\"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/Internet_dog.jpeg\"\n  width=\"460px\"\n  alt=\"The original internet dog meme: 'On the internet, no one knows you're a dog'\"\n  showalt\n/>\n\n### 5. Show up in meatspace\n\nThe final edge we have over language models is that we can prove we're real humans by showing up IRL with our real human bodies. We can arrange to meet Twitter mutuals offline over coffee. We can organise meetups and events and conferences and unconferences and hangouts and pub nights.\n\nIn [Markets for Lemons and the Great Logging Off](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/), Lars Doucet proposed several knock-on effects from this offline-first future. We might see increased [fetishisation](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/#:~:text=a%20resurgence%20and%20even%20fetishization%20of%20explicitly%20%22offline%22%20culture%2C%20where%20the%20%22Great%20Logging%20Off%22%20becomes%20literal) of anti-screen culture, as well as [real estate](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/#:~:text=Seventh%2C%20real,amenities%20are%20available) price increases in densely populated areas.\n\nFor the moment we can still check humanness over Zoom, but live video generation is getting good enough that I don't think that defence will last long.\n\nThere are, of course, many people who can't move to an offline-first life; people with physical disabilities. People who live in remote, rural places. People with limited time and caretaking responsibilities for the very young or the very old. They will have a harder time verifying their humanness online. I don't have any grand ideas to help solve this, but I hope we find better solutions than my paltry list.\n\nAs the forest grows darker, noisier, and less human, I expect to invest more time in in-person relationships and communities. And while I love meatspace, this still feels like a loss.\n\n<References>\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"Talking About Large Language Models\"\n    href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551\"\n    author=\"Murray Shanahan\"\n  />\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"AI: Markets for Lemons, and the Great Logging Off\"\n    href=\"https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/\"\n    author=\"Lars Doucet\"\n  />\n</References>\n\n{/* ### 4.

But more than anything, people are using the term to describe a new class of software. _Tools for thought_ is now a category tag in the databases of venture capital firms. The phrase appears on the landing page of every hot new knowledge management app:\n\n<ImageFrame\n  showalt\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1637794932/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/Muse_your_tool_for_thought_cqkrxu.png\"\n  alt=\"Muse App\"\n  margin=\"var(--space-s) auto\"\n/>\n\n<ImageFrame\n  showalt\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1661425097/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/Untitled_gm1f7n.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Anytype.io\"\n  margin=\"var(--space-s) auto\"\n/>\n\n<ImageFrame\n  showalt\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1637794932/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/Roam_Research_A_note_taking_tool_for_networked_thought._nbtjab.png\"\n  alt=\"Roam Research\"\n  margin=\"var(--space-s) auto\"\n/>\n\n<ImageFrame\n  showalt\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1651220448/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/Kosmik_tntaqh.png\"\n  alt=\"Kosmik App\"\n/>\n\nEven when it doesn't appear verbatim, we can see it in the subtext.

It appears to involve writing notes, connecting them to one another, exploring dynamic views, and then experiencing a kind of emergent wisdom. An enchanting promise.\n\nYet there's something paradoxical here; the phrase itself and the way we're collectively using it feel misaligned. Taken at face value, the phrase _tool for thought_ doesn't have the word 'computer' or 'digital' anywhere in it. It suggests nothing about software systems or interfaces. It's simply meant to refer to tools that help humans think thoughts; potentially new, different, and better kinds of thoughts than we currently think.\n\nWhile this might seem like a dumb rhetorical question, **what does any of this have to do with computers?**\n\nI think it's a question worth answering explicitly and comprehensively. If only to make clear to ourselves why we currently consider apps that allow you to link notes together the epitome of a _tool for thought_.\n\n## What is a tool for thought?\n\nWe're a bit too early in the establishment of this concept for anyone to have written a canonical definition yet. And like all significantly complex ideas, any proposed ones will be contested and controversial.\n\nWe can, however, get a rough estimation by looking at descriptions from some of the key texts we pass around the community.

They expanded our cognitive abilities and allowed us to solve problems that would otherwise be unsolvable.\n\nIt might feel strange to call some of these things ‚Äútools‚Äù. The scientific and Socratic methods seem more like _techniques_ for problem-solving. While drawing and writing are surely _mediums_ or _representations_ of ideas rather than ‚Äútools‚Äù?\n\nPart of this discomfort is a limitation of language. ‚ÄúTool‚Äù is a tricky category that we most often associate with physical objects. But we also use it to refer to less tangible techniques and mediums: fire, software development kits, slam poetry, democratic voting systems, design thinking, metaphors, and Google search filters are also called ‚Äútools.‚Äù\n\nI do think there's a meaningful distinction between tools and mediums: **Mediums are a means of communicating a thought or expressing an idea.** **Tools are a means of working in a medium.** Tools enable specific tasks and workflows within a medium. Cameras are a tool that let people express ideas through photography. Blogs are a tool that lets people express ideas through written language. JavaScript is a tool that let people express ideas through programming. Tools and mediums require each other. This makes lines between them fuzzy. And I'm unconvinced there's much utility in sharpening them.\n\nI'm going to proceed with a generous definition of ‚Äútool‚Äù for the rest of this piece. We could spend time splitting hairs and trying to hash out these categories. Or we could plough on by accepting any object, cultural practice, technique, or medium that expands human abilities as a _tool_.<Footnote idName={1}>I appreciate lumping these together is a gross philosophical oversimplification, but I can't dig into it without launching into a thousand-word side quest on Heidegger and McLuhan. We have other things to cover. Forgive the ontological laziness.</Footnote>\n\nThis gives us a mental model that looks something like this:\n\n<BasicImage\n  margin=\"0 auto var(--space-s)\"\n  width=\"800px\"\n  alt=\"A diagram of the category of tools encompassing cultural practices, techniques, objects, and mediums\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1651476166/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/Screenshot_-_2022-05-02_08.22.24_wjcvln.png\"\n/>\n\nMost of the examples I listed above are **cultural practices and techniques**. They are primary **ways of doing**; specific ways of thinking and acting that result in greater cognitive abilities. Ones that people pass down from generation to generation through culture.\n\nEvery one of these also pre-dates digital computers by at least a few hundred years, if not thousands or tens of thousands. Given that framing, it's time to return to the question of how computation, software objects, and note-taking apps fit into this narrative.\n\n## The Computational Roots of Tools for Thought\n\nMy simple interpretation of ‚Äútools for thought‚Äù up to this point takes the phrase at face value ‚Äì devoid of any historical context. Any sincere and holistic exploration of the phrase has to consider _who_ came up with the term, and what particular _cultural and historical contexts_ they were part of.\n\nIf you look around at the commonly cited ‚Äúmajor thinkers‚Äù in this space, you get a list of computer programmers: Kenneth Iverson, J.C.R. Licklider, Vannevar Bush, Alan Kay, Bob Taylor, Douglas Englebart, Seymour Papert, Bret Victor, and Howard Rheingold, among others.\n\nI would be remiss not to point out all of these figures are male, white, from North America, and associated with various prestigious technical universities such as MIT, Caltech, Stanford, and UC Berkley. Most were hanging out in California from the 1960s up through the 1990s working on advances in networked computing, personal computing, and interface design. This demographic is so overwhelmingly consistent that they're sometimes called the ‚Äúpatriarchs‚Äù of tools for thought.<Footnote idName={2}>In Howard Rheingold's [Tools for Thought](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262681155/tools-for-thought/) (1985)</Footnote>\n\nThis is relevant because it means these men share a lot of the same beliefs, values, and context. They know the same sorts of people, learned the same historical stories in school and were taught to see the world in particular kinds of ways. Most of them worked together, or are at most one personal connection away from the next. Tools for thought is a community scene as much as it's a concept.\n\nThis gives _tools for thought_ a distinctly computer-oriented, male, American, middle-class flavour. The term has always been used in relation to a dream that is deeply intertwined with digital machines, white-collar knowledge work, and bold American optimism.\n\n### A History of Computational TFT\n\nThe phrase itself is not that old. It was first used by Kenneth Iverson in his research work on programming notation throughout the 1950s and '60s.<Footnote idName={3}>Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen, <a href=\"https://numinous.productions/ttft/\">(2019)</a></Footnote>. His first public paper mentioning it is [Notation as a Tool for Thought](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358896.358899) published by the ACM in 1979<Footnote isClosed idName={4}>The Association for Computing Machinery; the institutional big wigs of academic computer science</Footnote>.\n\n<ImageFrame\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1657921618/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/iverson_rvefej.png\"\n  alt=\"Iverson's 1979 paper on mathematical notation as a tool for thought\"\n  showalt\n/>\n\nIverson argued that establishing shared notation within a discipline ‚Äì be it biological, mathematical, or programmatic ‚Äì can relieve our working memory and compress complex meanings into concise forms.\n\nNotation is only one small aspect of the larger tools for thought vision. While Iverson was the first to give this philosophy a distinct name, others were already exploring many of the same themes using different terms.\n\nBack in 1945 [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush#cite_note-As_We_May_Think-85) published an essay titled [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) in both _The Atlantic_ and _Life Magazine_ ‚Äì two publications with a wide readership. In it, he proposed the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), an imaginary ‚Äúmemory extension‚Äù machine that would help people explore information and craft their own hyperlinked research journeys through it. Many of the later thinkers in the tools for thought movement cite this article as a key influence.\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  alt=\"The cover image for the original publication of 'As We May Think'\"\n  margin=\"1rem auto 3rem\"\n  width=\"800px\"\n  src=\"/images/posts/tools-for-thought/aswemaythink.jpeg\"\n/>\n\n<BasicImage\n  showalt\n  margin=\"0 auto 3rem\"\n  alt=\"Vannevar's vision of a Memex machine ‚Äì a desk with built-in microfilm displays\"\n  width=\"800px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1589545798/maggieappleton.com/notes/memex.jpg\"\n/>\n\nThis is one of the earliest visions of how computers might be able to augment human cognitive capacities. Others soon took up the mantle.\n\n[J.C.R. Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider) built on Vannevar's ideas throughout the 1950s and '60s while teaching at MIT. His 1960 article [Man-Computer Symbiosis](http://memex.org/licklider.pdf) predicts a future where \"men and computers cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations.\" Where we would have marvels like ‚Äúcomputer-posted wall displays‚Äù for critical data, and ‚Äúautomatic human speech production and recognition.‚Äù\n\nThat all sound quite banal to us now. We have plenty of giant dashboards and voice assistants. Every decision made in complex situations like government, infrastructure engineering, medicine, or law involves extensive (hu)man-computer collaboration and augmentation. We have already achieved many of the wildest dreams of this generation. Computers are deeply integrated into every institution. And every individual life. They are affordable, easily accessible, and always available. Literally in our pockets.\n\nBut simply because we've drastically improved human-computer collaboration since 1960 doesn't mean we've peaked. It's still unclear how much our current status quo helps or hinders our capacity to deal with complex problems. The work of [Douglas Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) helps shed some light on this. His extensive essay [Augmenting Human Intellect](https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html) (1962) has become another touchstone for the community. It proposes a more ambitious vision for using computers to extend our cognitive abilities.\n\n<TwoColumn width=\"1000px\" alignItems=\"top\" margin=\"0 auto 4rem\">\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  framed\n  margin=\"0\"\n  src=\"/images/posts/tools-for-thought/ahi.jpg\"\n  alt=\"The original cover of Englebart's Augmenting Human Intellect essay\"\n/>\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  framed\n  margin=\"0\"\n  src=\"/images/posts/tools-for-thought/ahi3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"The first paragraph of Englebart's Augmenting Human Intellect essay\"\n/>\n\n</TwoColumn>\n\nEnglebart was specifically concerned with our ability to deal with complex problems, rather than simply ‚Äúamplifying intelligence.‚Äù Being able to win a chess match is perceived as intelligent, but it isn't helping us tackle systemic racism or inequality. Englebart argued we should instead focus on ‚Äú_augmenting_ human intellect‚Äù in ways that help us find solutions to wicked problems. While he painted visions of how computers could facilitate this, he also pointed to organisational structures, system dynamics, and effective training as part of this puzzle.\n\nAfter Bush, Licklider, and Englebart's well-publicised presentations and writing made the rounds, many other thinkers became interested in the problem of expanding human reasoning with machines. [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) proposed plenty of [software patterns](/xanadu-patterns) for storing, connecting, and organising ideas. Researchers at [Xerox PARC](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)>) like [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) and [Bob Taylor](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)>) developed the foundations of personal computing ‚Äì graphical interfaces, ethernet, WYSIWYG word-processing, and the desktop metaphor. These inventions changed computers from large, corporate calculation machines into personal devices used in every home and school.\n\nKay would go on to become one of the leading voices of tools for thought. In essays like ‚Äú[Personal Dynamic Media](http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-26-kay.pdf)‚Äù (1977) and ‚Äú[User Interface:](http://worrydream.com/refs/Kay%20-%20User%20Interface,%20a%20Personal%20View.pdf) [A Personal View](http://worrydream.com/refs/Kay%20-%20User%20Interface,%20a%20Personal%20View.pdf)‚Äù (1989) he paints a vision of thinking with computers that go beyond what we've achieved so far. In recent years he's become fond of the line ‚Äú**the personal computing revolution hasn't happened yet**‚Äù [1](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC0_TDrmllM) [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY) ‚Äì meaning since the initial advances in the '70s and '80s, we've failed to make significant progress towards real computational tools for thought.\n\n<TwoColumn width=\"1000px\" alignItems=\"top\" margin=\"0 auto 4rem\">\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  framed\n  margin=\"0\"\n  src=\"/images/posts/tools-for-thought/kay1.jpg\"\n  alt=\"The cover of Kay's 1989 essay on User Interfaces\"\n/>\n\n<ResponsiveImage\n  framed\n  margin=\"0\"\n  src=\"/images/posts/tools-for-thought/kay3.jpg\"\n  alt=\"The cover of Kay and Goldberg's 1977 essay on Personal Dynamic Media\"\n/>\n\n</TwoColumn>\n\nMuch of the history I've just swept through is covered in Howard Rheingold's 1985 book [Tools for Thought](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/tools-thought) ‚Äì an account of major innovations that led to the personal computer and the philosophical lineage of those building it. Michael Hiltzik's [Dealers of Lightning](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Dealers_of_Lightning/lzgOduibRJgC?hl=en) is another good chronicle of the work done at Xerox PARC. There is also an edited collection of key texts in this domain called [The New Media Reader](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262232272/the-new-media-reader/) that I've heard multiple people call ‚Äúthe bible of tools for thought.‚Äù<Footnote idName={5}>You can pick up a used copy for under ¬£5.

They aren't exploring how meditation, architecture, complementary medicine, or music composition might enable new kinds of thoughts. The computer is vital.\n\n## Beyond Computers: Cognitive Scientists and Philosophers on Tools for Thought\n\nThere is a rich literature of research and insight into how we might expand human thought that sometimes feels entirely detached from the history we just covered. Cognitive scientists and philosophers have been tackling questions about the relationship between cognition, our tools, and our physical environments for centuries. Well before microprocessors and hypertext showed up. Oddly, they're rarely cited by the computer scientists.\n\nThis alternate intellectual lineage is still asking the question ‚Äúhow can we develop better tools for thinking?‚Äù But they don't presume the answer revolves around computers.\n\nSeven years before Rheingold published his book ‚ÄúTools for Thought,‚Äù another book was published with the same name. In 1977, the biologist and philosopher [C.H. Waddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._H._Waddington) released a book exploring the nature of complex systems. He discussed philosophies and problem-solving tools for wicked problems. Computers are mentioned in passing ‚Äì as one tool among many ‚Äì but are never the focus.\n\n<ResourceBook\nurl=\"https://g.co/kgs/Jvcmfo\"\ntitle=\"Tools for Thought\"\nauthor=\"C. H. Waddington\"\nimage=\"/images/books/tftwaddington.jpeg\"\n>\n\nWaddington presents a set of philosophies and problem-solving tools for dealing with complex systems. The book covers classical systems thinking topics like hierarchical dynamics, feedback loops, zero-sum games, and forecasting.\n\n</ResourceBook>\n\n<Spacer size=\"xs\" />\n\nPhilosopher [Andy Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Clark) has spent his career exploring how external tools transform and expand human cognition. His 2003 book [Natural-born Cyborgs](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Natural_born_Cyborgs/8JXaK3sREXQC?hl=en) argues humans have ‚Äúalways been [[cyborgs]].‚Äù Not in the sense of embedding wires into our flesh, but in the sense we enter ‚Äúinto deep and complex relationships with nonbiological constructs, props, and aids‚Äù. Our ability to _think with_ external objects is precisely what makes us intelligent.\n\nClark argues ‚Äúthe mind‚Äù isn't simply a set of functions within the brain, but a process that happens _between_ our bodies and the physical environment. Intelligence emerges at the intersection of humans and tools. He expanded on this idea in a follow-on book called [Supersizing the Mind](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Supersizing_the_Mind/n5wRDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0). It became known as the [extended mind hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis). It's the strong version of theories like [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition), [situated cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition), and [enacted cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enactivism) that are all the rage in cognitive science departments.\n\n<ResourceBook\nurl=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Supersizing_the_Mind/n5wRDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0\"\ntitle=\"Supersizing the Mind\"\nauthor=\"Andy Clark\"\nimage=\"/images/books/supersize.jpg\"\n>\n\nClark presents the emerging field of embodied cognition, which explores the ways that our thoughts and actions are intertwined with our physical bodies and the world around us. He explored the importance of context, timing, biomechanics, and dynamics in how humans think with the world around them.\n\n</ResourceBook>\n\nEmbodied cognition\n\nThe main arguments of embodied cognition are that our thoughts and cognitive processes are influenced by and arise from our bodily experiences and sensorimotor interactions with the world. This view challenges the traditional idea that the mind is a separate, abstract entity that is independent of the body, and instead proposes that the mind is embodied and situated in the physical world. Proponents of embodied cognition argue that our perceptions, concepts, and cognitive processes are shaped by the physical structures of our body and the sensory experiences it provides, and that cognition cannot be fully understood without considering the bodily basis of our experiences.\n\n{/* Clark's work has plenty of implications for our computational ‚Äútools for thought‚Äù community. If our minds are not something trapped within our brains, but a constantly unfolding process between our bodies and the tools we have at hand, this isn't a matter of */}\n\n<Draft />\n\n<div style={{ opacity: \"50%\"}}>\n\n[Barbara Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tversky) has four decades of research on cognition, embodiment, and visualisation where she repeatedly uses the term. <Footnote idName={5}>Wife to the late, great [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky). Famous for his collaboration with [Daniel Kahnneman]() and the development of behavioural economics</Footnote>\n\nThe philosopher Daniel Dennett published Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking in 2013\n\n<ResourceBook\nurl=\"https://www.librarything.com/work/13457191\"\ntitle=\"Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking\"\nauthor=\"Daniel Dennett\"\nimage=\"/images/books/intuitionpumps.jpg\"\n>\n\n...\n\n</ResourceBook>\n\nTim Ingold is both an anthropologist and philosopher who has written numerous books about our relationship to and perception of our physical environment.\n\n<ResourceBook url=\"\" title=\"Making: Anthropology, Art, Architecture, and Archeology\" author=\"Tim Ingold\" image=\"/images/books/making.jpg\">\n\n</ResourceBook>\n\nWe'll return to these non-computational interpretations of ‚Äútools for thought‚Äù later on. They shouldn't be dismissed or cast as irrelevant to the narratives that computer nerds have written.\n\n## Computers as the Meta-medium\n\nIs this particular focus on computers justified?\n\nAlan Turing first called computers ‚Äúuniversal reasoning machines‚Äù ‚Äì machines capable of simulating many other kind of machines. General purpose machines expand what is possible. Computers as a meta-medium that can mimic all other kinds of mediums. They mimic paper and pencil, calculators, painting canvases...\n\nComputers can dynamically simulate\n\n\"Computers are without a doubt the most potent thinking tools we have, not just because they take the drudgery out of many intellectual tasks, but also because many of the concepts computer scientists have invented are excellent thinking tools in their own right.\" - Dennett (2013)\n\n‚ÄúAlthough digital computers were originally designed to do arithmetic computation, the ability to simulate the details of any descriptive model means that the computer, viewed as a medium itself, can be all other media if the embedding and viewing methods are sufficiently well provided. Moreover, this new ‚Äúmetamedium‚Äù is active‚Äîit can respond to queries and experiments‚Äîso that the messages may involve the learner in a two-way conversation. This property has never been available before except through the medium of an individual teacher. We think the implications are vast and compelling‚Äù - Kay and Goldberg (1977)\n\n‚ÄúIf such a machine were designed in a way that any owner could mold and channel its power to his own needs, then a new kind of medium would have been created: a metamedium, whose content would be a wide range of already-existing and not-yet-invented media.‚Äù - Kay and Goldberg (1977)\n\nIt would be more accurate to rename tools for thought to _computational mediums for thought_. Or CMFT for short.\n\nCMFT would actually be a subset of the larger field of tools for thought, since as we established earlier, the vast majority of historical tools for thought are not in the least bit computational.\n\n[image of CMFT as a subset of TFT]\n\nWhich should make us pause to ask: Are CMFT's significantly different to other TFTs?\n\n## The Second Wave of Tools for Thought\n\nA major narrative within the tools for thought community is the loss of historical progress. There's a lot of lamenting the historical break between the early pioneers of personal computing and the current state of computing. The nineties and early oughts are cast as the fallow times. While software ‚Äú[ate the world](),‚Äù millions came online, and Windows 95 graced every desktop, this period is seen as a turn away from the original vision.\n\nBret Victor was the first to call attention to this historical gap in a series of talks between 2013 to 2015.\n\n[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/)'s 2019 essay on [transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) helped kick off the new popularity wave, as well as Andy's [continued research](https://www.patreon.com/quantumcountry) and writing advocating for TFT as a field.\n\n<ImageFrame\n  width=\"1200\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1637795112/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/How_can_we_develop_transformative_tools_for_thought_i64mlz.png\"\n  alt=\"\"\n/>\n\nMatuschak and Nielsen's essay made a dent in the software development community.\n\n## Rise of the Note-takers\n\nAround the end of 2019, as Matuschak and Nielsen's essay is being passed around, we begin to see the rise of a few new \"note-taking\" apps. I put \"note-taking\" in quotations because the activity we're going to talk about here is only tangentially about taking notes, but we've all taken to using the idea of note-taking as a shorthand way to refer to it.\n\nWhat we are talking about is software that allows people to enagage in a few key activities:\n\n- Write in a linear text format\n- Collect information\n- Store information\n- Search and find information\n- Connect information\n\nBefore this moment, the major players in the market are tools like Evernote, OneNote, Notion, and Apple Notes. There are plenty of smaller apps serving niche use cases. But there's a clear inflection point in mid-2020 in this field where the number and diversity of ‚Äúnote-taking‚Äù applications drastically increases. [need evidence for this claim]\n\n[Roam Research]() is one of the central software characters in this story. In late 2019 and early 2020 the beta version gains a slew of new users<Footnote idName={6}>For transparency I should state I started using Roam as my primary knowledge base in November of 2019 so my understanding of this history is certainly coloured by that affiliation.</Footnote>\n\nObsidian comes out in xxxx. Logseq is released in xxxx. At this point it seems the floodgates are open.\n\nIn short order, we get Clover, Craft, Remnote, Mem.ai, Scrintal, Heptabase, Reflect, Muse, Thunknotes, Kosmik, Fermat, and XXX.\n\nThere's a scramble to make sense of all these new releases and the differences between them. YouTube and Medium explode with DIY guides, walkthrough tours, and comparison videos. The productivity and knowledge management influencer is born.\n\n[ giant wall of productivity youtube nonsense ]\n\nThe strange thing is, many of these guides are only superficially about the application they're presented in. Most are teaching specific cultural techniques:\n\nZettelkasten, spaced repetition, critical thinking.\n\nThese techniques are only focused on a narrow band of human activity. Specifically, activity that white-collar knowledge workers engage in.\n\nI previously suggested we should rename TFT to CMFT (computational mediums for thought), but that doesn't go far enough. If we're being honest about our current interpretation of TFT's, we should actually rename it to CMFWCKW ‚Äì computational mediums for white-collar knowledge work.\n\n## Thinking Beyond Note-taking Software\n\nBy now it should be clear that this question of developing better tools for thought can and should cover a _much_ wider scope than developing novel note-taking software.\n\n- Forecasting and prediction markets\n  - Guesstimate\n  - Squiggle\n  - Metaculus\n- Better critical reasoning\n  - Socratic debate\n- Audio and visual\n  - Photoshop\n  - MaxMSP\n  - Logic Pro\n    - Jacob Collier streams\n- Game dev and dynamics\n  - Houdini\n  - Blueprint\n- ML Assistants\n  - Elicit for rigorous research\n- Spatial understanding\n  - Nothing that teaches the Alexander technique, movement, spatial awareness, dance\n  - Argonauts of the Western Pacific\n  - Remembrances of Times East\n\n</div>\n\n## Recorded talk version\n\n<Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6uhvFGPUE0\" />\n\n<References>\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"User Interface: A Personal View (1989)\"\n    href=\"http://worrydream.com/refs/Kay%20-%20User%20Interface,%20a%20Personal%20View.pdf\"\n    author=\"Alan Kay\"\n  />\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"How can we develop transformative tools for thought?\"\n    href=\"https://numinous.productions/ttft/\"\n    author=\"Andy Matuschak & Michael Nielsen\"\n  />\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"Augmenting Human Intellect\"\n    href=\"https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138\"\n    author=\"Douglas Englebart\"\n  />\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"The Humane Representation of Thought\"\n    href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdP2Bmieg\"\n    author=\"Bret Victor\"\n  />\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"Media for Thinking the Unthinkable\"\n    href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUaOucZRlmE\"\n    author=\"Bret Victor\"\n  />\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"The Cognitive Design of Tools of Thought\"\n    href=\"http://gjgreenberg.bol.ucla.edu/docs/rpp/04_tversky.pdf\"\n    author=\"Barbara Tversky\"\n  />\n  <ReferencesLink\n    title=\"Dave Winer's thoughts on the new TFT hype\"\n    href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought\"\n    author=\"Dave Winer\"\n  />\n</References>\n","data":{"title":"Tools for Thought as Cultural Practices, not Computational Objects","description":"On seeing tools for thought through a historical and anthropological lens","startDate":"2021-07-29","updated":"2022-11-22","type":"essay","toc":true,"featured":true,"cover":"/images/covers/tft@2x.png","topics":["Talks","Tools for Thought","Roam","Design","Anthropology"],"aliases":["Tools for Thought as Cultural Practices"],"growthStage":"budding"},"slug":"tools-for-thought","filePath":"tools-for-thought.mdx"},{"content":"\n<BasicImage\n  margin=\"0 auto\"\n  alt=\"A browser frame with a small garden growing in front of it.\"\n  width=\"750px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1622719121/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/garden-main_ayoaqo_shrink_szbgc7.png\"\n/>\n\n<IntroParagraph>\n\nBack in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where there is something culturally compelling about this concept.\n\n</IntroParagraph>\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"1250532315459194880\" />\n\nMy [small collection](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880) highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.\n\nThey're not following the conventions of the \"_personal blog_,\" as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.\n\nA garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory ‚Äì notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.\n\n<BasicImage\n  width=\"850px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1616170717/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/growth-leaves_gtdalf.png\"\n/>\n\nIt harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites \"_should be_.‚Äù It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.\n\n---\n\n## A Brief History of Digital Gardens\n\nLet's go on a short journey to the origin of this word. The notion of a _digital garden_ is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades. However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.\n\nTracing back how [[Neologisms]] are born helps us understand why anyone needed this word in the first place. Language is always a response to the evolving world around us ‚Äì we expand it when our current vocabulary fails to capture what we're observing, or have a particular desire for how we'd like the future to unfold. Naming is a political act as much as a poetic one.\n\n### The Early Gardens of Hypertext\n\nMark Bernstein's 1998 essay [Hypertext Gardens](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html) appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. Mark was part of the early hypertext crowd ‚Äì the developers figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.\n\nWhile the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.\n\n<TwoColumn>\n\n<img\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174712/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Hypertext_Gardens_fsudk6.png\"\n/>\n\n<img\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174705/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Gardens_and_Paths_g0wfdw.png\"\n/>\n\n<img\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174707/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Seven_Lessons_dng4bf.png\"\n/>\n\n<img\n  alt=\"A screenshot of Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_800/v1614174712/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Establishing_Order_t1phoe.png\"\n/>\n\n</TwoColumn>\n\n<Subtext>Let's note that Mark's graphics are to die for</Subtext>\n\nTo put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a larger conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.\n\nThe early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by [WikiGardeners](https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener) and [WikiGnomes.](https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGnome)<Footnote idName={1}>The caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites.</Footnote>\nThese creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.\n\nThe early web debates around this became known as [_The Navigation Problem_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31) ‚Äì the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.\n\n> \"Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes\"\n\nWhile Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.\n\nAfter Mark's essay the term **digital gardening** goes quiet for nearly a decade.\n\n### Digital Puttering on Twitter\n\nIn April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term \"**digital gardening**\", but defined it as _\"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people\"_ <Footnote idName={2}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, \"faffing‚Äù means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"34981652\" />\n\nThe next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment ‚Äì people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **the act of cleaning up one's digital space**. The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.\n\nThese people were **digital puttering** more than gardening.\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"1616935301\" />\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"10102084267\" />\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"40614201554640896\" />\n\nSince none of these folks reference to the earlier nineties notion of **digital gardening**, or mention issues of hypertext navigation, this use of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter in the early days, these people probably belonged to the same social flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one strict meaning to the term.\n\nThat said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.\n\n### Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors\n\nAt the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on [The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo). It later becomes [a hefty essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. **If anyone should be considered the original source of _digital gardening_, it's Caufield.** They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.\n\nCaufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools ‚Äì it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a **different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information** - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.\n\nCaufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by _streams_ ‚Äì the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events. The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting ‚Äì they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments. <Footnote idName={3}>While this may sound obvious now, the streamification of everything was still dawning around 2015.</Footnote>\n\nThis is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the game.\n\nBut streams only surface the Zeitgeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. <Footnote idName={4}>Though the rising popularity of [Twitter threading](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/) is an impressive attempt to reconfigure a stream environment and make it more garden-esque.</Footnote>\n\n<br />\n\nThe _garden_ is our counterbalance. **Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.** Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from [Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevism) to [Celestial Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics) to [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number). It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. **The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.**\n\n> \"The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It‚Äôs the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.\"\n\n### Carrying on Caufield\n\nGood ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.\n\nIn late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly ‚Äì folks began passing around Caufield's original article and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into exploratory, interlinked gardens.\n\nTom Critchlow's 2018 article [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add _campfires_ to the idea of streams and gardens ‚Äì the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and [[Cozy Web]] areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.\n\nTom piece was shortly followed by Joel Hooks' [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) in early 2019. <Footnote idName={5}>Disclaimer that Joel is a mentor, collaborator and friend, so my exposure to the idea comes from his early advocacy and enthusiasm for it.</Footnote> Joel focused on the _process_ of digital gardening, emphasising the slow growth of ideas through writing, rewriting, editing, and revising thoughts in public. Instead of slapping Fully Formed Opinions up on the web and never changing them.\n\nJoel also added Amy Hoy's [How the Blog Broke the Web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) post to the pile of influential ideas that led to our current gardening infatuation. While not specifically about gardening, Amy's piece gives us a lot of good historical context. In it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of [Moveable Type](https://www.movabletype.org/)).\n\nAmy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the \"**Chronological Sort Era**\". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS yourself.\n\n> \"Suddenly people weren‚Äôt creating homepages or even web pages... they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a web page.\"\n\nMany people have lamented the web's slow transition from unique homepages to a bland ocean of generic Wordpress themes. Digital gardening is part of the pushback against the limited range of vanilla web formats and layouts we now for granted.\n\nOver the course 2019 and early 2020, more and more people began riffing on the concept. Shaun Wang compiled the [Digital Gardening Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/). Anne-Laure Le Cunff published a popular guide to setting up [No-code Digital Gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up). The IndieWeb community hosted a [pop-up session](https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-ups/GardenAndStream) to discuss the history of commonplace books, personal wikis, and memory palaces.\n\nBy late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the MIT Tech Review to write [a short piece](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) on it. Perhaps this is the watershed moment when a Twitter buzzword has \"made it.\"\n\n<ImageFrame\n  width=\"1100px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1622719057/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/mit-gardens_shrink_vpgbsl.png\"\n  showalt\n  alt=\"A feature about digital gardening on MIT's tech review\"\n/>\n\n### Digital Gardening's Fertile Soil\n\nWhat made our current historical moment the right time for digital gardening to take off?\n\nThe timing coincided with a few complimentary ideas and communities rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and reimagining tools for blogging. The scene was ripe for new ideas around curating and sharing personal knowledge online.\n\nMany of the people who jumped on the early digital gardening bandwagon were part of communities like...\n\n- The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) collective ‚Äì a group that has been championing independent web spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook for nearly a decade.\n- Users of the note-taking app [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) ‚Äì Roam pioneered new ways of interlinking content and strongly appeals to people trying to build sprawling knowledge graphs.\n- Followers of Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course which popularised the idea of actively curating personal knowledge.\n- People rallying around the [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) ethos that encourages continuously creating 'learning exhaust' in the form of notes and summaries.\n\n### Developer-led Gardening\n\nMany of these early adopters were people who understood how to build websites ‚Äì either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists. Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live. Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might look like.\n\nThe current state of web development helped here too. While it feels like we've been in a slow descent into a horrifyingly complex and bloated web development process, a number of recent tools have made it easier to get a fully customised website up and running. Services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) have taken the pain out of deployment. Static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/) make it easier to build sophisticated websites that auto-generate pages, and take care of grunt work like optimising load time, images, and SEO. <Footnote idName={6}>Plenty of people will disagree that this explosion of JavaScript-stuffed rubbish is a net gain for the web. We all lament the loss of being able to upload pure HTML and CSS files via FTP. But those days are gone, and the only thing we can do now is slowly untangle our JavaScript spaghetti and package it up into more accessible build tools.</Footnote> These services are trying to find a happy middle ground between tediously hand-coding solutions, and being trapped in the restrictions of Wordpress or Squarespace.\n\nWhile developers were the first on the scene, plenty of writers, researchers, and note-taking enthusiasts have been drawn to the idea of digital gardening.\nTo help folks without programming skills join in, there's been a surge in templates and platforms that allow people to build their own digital gardens without touching a ton of code. I've written an entire guide to [[Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks]] if you fall into that category.\n\nTools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) are all great options. Many of them offer fancy features like nested folders, [[Bi-Directional Links]], footnotes, and visual graphs.\n\nHowever, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the [information architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't \"count,‚Äù as \"real‚Äù gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.\n\n---\n\n## The Six Patterns of Gardening\n\nIn all the recent gardening flurry, we've run into the inevitable confusion around how to define the term.\n\n<TweetEmbed tweetId=\"1260368292851535879\" />\n\nThere are contested ideas about what qualifies as a garden, what the core ethos should focus on, and whether it's worthy of a new label at all. What exactly makes a website a _digital garden_ as opposed to just another blog?\n\nAfter reading all the existing takes on the term, observing a wide variety of gardens, and collecting some of the [best examples](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), I've identified a few key qualities they all share.\n\nThere are a few guiding principles, design patterns and structures people are rallying around. This amounts to a kind of digital gardening [[Pattern Language]].\n\n<Spacer size=\"small\" />\n\n### 1. Topography over Timelines\n\nGardens are organised around **contextual relationships and associative links**; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.\n\nThis runs counter to the time-based structure of traditional blogs: posts presented in reverse chronological order based on publication date.\n\nGardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden. Posts are connected to other by posts through related themes, topics, and shared context.\n\nOne of the best ways to do this is through [[Bi-Directional Links]] ‚Äì links that make both the destination page and the source page visible to the reader. This makes it easy to move between related content.\n\n<BasicImage\n  width=\"900px\"\n  alt=\"A linear timeline of posts vs. a spatial layout of connected posts\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1100/v1621774501/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/topographytimelines_shrink_jxgw9l.png\"\n/>\n\nBecause garden notes are densely linked, a garden explorer can enter at any location and follow any trail they link through the content, rather than being dumped into a \"most recent‚Äù feed.\n\nDense links are essential, but gardeners often layer on other ways of exploring their knowledge base. They might have [thematic piles](https://busterbenson.com/piles/), [nested folders](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/), tags and filtering functionality, [advanced search bars](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/garden), [visual node graphs](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), or [central indexes](https://www.gwern.net/index) listing notable and popular content.\n\nMany entry points but no prescribed pathways.\n\n<Spacer />\n\n### 2. Continuous Growth\n\nGardens are never finished, they're **constantly growing, evolving, and changing**. Just like a real soil, carrot, and cabbage garden.\n\nThe isn't how we usually think about writing on the web. Over the last decade, we've moved away from casual live journal entries and formalised our writing into _articles_ and _essays_. These are carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's done, it's done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off to the printer.\n\nThis is odd considering editability is one of the main selling points of the web. Gardens lean into this ‚Äì there is no \"final version‚Äù on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion. <Footnote idName={7}>Or more likely, contraction and clarification</Footnote>\n\nGardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you first have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined. You might notice a pattern in your corner of the world, but need to collect evidence, consider counter-arguments, spot similar trends, and research who else has thunk such thoughts before you. In short, you need to do your homework and critically think about it over time.\n\n<BasicImage\n  width=\"950px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1621773885/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/gardentime_rrsecv.png\"\n  alt=\"A graph of time versus amount of work. Gardening involves small amounts of work over time, while classic blogging involves a lot of work all at once.\"\n/>\n\nIn performance-blog-land you do that thinking and researching privately, then shove it out at the final moment. A grand flourish that hides the process.\n\nIn garden-land, that process of researching and refining happens on the open internet. You post ideas while they're still \"seedlings,‚Äù and tend them regularly until they're fully grown, respectable opinions.\n\nThis has a number of benefits:\n\n- You're freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately. You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a good internet citizen.\n- It's _low friction_. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual that only takes a small amount of effort. Over time, big things grow.\n- It gives readers an insight into your writing and thinking process. They come to realise you are not a magical idea machine banging out perfectly formed thoughts, but instead an equally mediocre human doing The Work of trying to understand the world and make sense of it alongside you.\n\nThis all comes with an important caveat; **gardens make their imperfection known to readers**. Which brings us to the next pattern...\n\n<Spacer />\n\n### 3. Imperfection & Learning in Public\n\nGardens are **imperfect by design**. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.\n\nPutting anything imperfect and half-written on an \"official website‚Äù may feel strange. <Footnote idName={8}>We seem to reserve all our imperfect declarations and poorly-worded announcements for platforms that other people own and control.</Footnote> We have all been trained to behave like tiny, performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in digital space. Blogging evolved in the [Premium Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) culture of Millenialism as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand‚Ñ¢ and market your SEO-optimized Content.\n\nWeird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns. Everyone now has a modern minimalist logo and an LLC.\n\nDigital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/) response to the professional personal blog; it's both intimate and public, weird and welcoming. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than a Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations.\n\nThink of it as a spectrum. Things we dump into private WhatsApp group chats, DMs, and cavalier Tweet threads are part of our _chaos streams_ - a continuous flow of high noise / low signal ideas. On the other end we have highly performative and cultivated artefacts like published books that you prune and tend for years.\n\nGardening sits in the middle. It's the perfect balance of chaos and cultivation.\n\n<BasicImage\n  width=\"1000px\"\n  alt=\"a spectrum of knowledge management, ranging from chaos streams to the cultivated performance of publishing a book. Gardening sits in the middle.\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1593765637/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/digital-garden.png\"\n/>\n\nThis ethos of imperfection opens up a world of possibility that performative blogging shut down. First, it enables you to [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/); the practice of sharing what you learn as you're learning it, not a decade later once you're an \"expert.‚Äù <Footnote idName={9}>A label you may never officially earn unless you're in a highly structured and bureaucratised industry that loves explicit hierarchy rankings. The rest of us are left to deal with perpetual imposter syndrome.</Footnote>\n\nThis freedom of course comes with great responsibility. Publishing imperfect and early ideas **requires that we make the status of our notes clear to readers.** You should include some indicator of how \"done‚Äù they are, and how much effort you've invested in them.\n\nThis could be with a simple categorisation system. I personally use an overly horticultural metaphor:\n\n- üå± _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas\n- üåø _Budding_ for work I've cleaned up and clarified\n- üå≥ _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).\n\nI also include the dates I _planted_ and _last tended_ a post so people get a sense of how long I've been growing it.\n\n<ImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1621931871/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/metadata_jtz6od.png\"\n  alt=\"The metadata at the top of my posts showing growth stage\"\n/>\n\nOther gardeners include an **epistemic status** on their posts ‚Äì a short statement that makes clear how they know what they know, and how much time they've invested in researching it.\n\n[Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/index) was one of the earliest and most consistent gardeners to offer meta-reflections on their work.\nEach entry comes with:\n\n- topic tags\n- start and end date\n- a stage tag: _draft_, _in progress_, or _finished_\n- a certainty tag: _impossible_, _unlikely_, _certain_, etc.\n- 1-10 importance tag\n\nThese are all explained in their [website guide](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags), which is worth reading if you're designing your own epistemological system.\n\n<ImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1621499882/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Screenshot_-_2021-05-20_09.35.37_shrink_x79dnz.png\"\n  showalt\n  alt=\"The metadata available on each of Gwern's essays\"\n/>\n\nDevon Zuegal is another notable gardener who has _epistemic status_ and _epistemic effort_ on their posts, indicating both their certainty level about the material, and how much effort went into making it. They also make a strong case for [lazy epistemic statuses](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing) as a feature, not a bug.\n\n<ImageFrame\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1621838735/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/Screenshot_-_2021-05-24_07.44.48_shrink_rg7rec.png\"\n  alt=\"Epistemic effort and epistemic status metadata at the top of Devon Zuegal's writing\"\n  showalt\n/>\n\nIn a similar vein, Shawn Wang has written the Digital Gardening [Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos) which I adore and ascribe to. They ask the reader to allow the writer to be wrong, offer constructive criticism, and attribute their work. They ask gardeners to be considerate of others (don't share private information or name and shame), offer epistemic disclosure, and respond to feedback.\n\n<img\n  width=\"900px\"\n  src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/75324412-e3bc2480-5844-11ea-90be-4a26b6a64000.png\"\n  alt=\"The digital gardening terms of service ‚Äì Source: Shawn Wang, swyx.io\"\n  showalt\n/>\n\nAll of these design patterns feed our growing desire for transparency, meta information, and breadcrumbs back to the source of ideas.\n\n<Spacer />\n\n### 4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental\n\nGardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants.\n\nDigital gardens should be just as unique and particular as their vegetative counterparts. The point of a garden is that it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised template.\n\n<BasicImage\n  width=\"900px\"\n  alt=\"A row of four plants where three look identical and one is wild and different\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1609617065/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/unique-gardens_shrink.png\"\n/>\n\nIdeally, this involves experimenting with the native languages of the web ‚Äì HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They're the most flexible and robust tools we have for building interconnected knowledge online. Gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a '_personal website_', and make space for weirder, wilder experiments.\n\nThat said, I should acknowledge that jumping into full-on web development is simply beyond the abilities and interests of many people. There is still room for personalisation and play if you're using a pre-made template or service ‚Äì it'll just be within the constraints of that system.\n\nOne goal of these hyper-personalised gardens is deep **contextualisation**. The overwhelming lesson of the Web 2.0 social media age is that dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social spaces is a shit show. Devoid of any established social norms and abstracted from our specific cultural identities, we end up in awkward, aggravating exchanges with people who are socially incoherent to us. We know nothing of their lives, backgrounds, or belief systems, and have to assume the worst. Twitter only offers us a 240 character bio. Facebook pre-selects the categories it deems important about you ‚Äì relationship status, gender, hometown.\n\nGardens offer us the ability to present ourselves in forms that aren't cookie cutter profiles. They're the higher-fidelity version, complete with quirks, contradictions, and complexity.\n\n<Spacer size=\"small\" />\n\n### 5. Intercropping & Content Diversity\n\nGardens are not just a collection of interlinked words. While linear writing is an incredible medium that has served us well for a little over 5000 years, it is daft to pretend working in a single medium is a sufficient way to explore complex ideas.\n\nIt is also absurd to ignore the fact we're living in an audio-visual cornucopia that the web makes possible. Podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden.\n\n<img\n  width=\"800px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1000/v1621781288/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/intercropping-garden_shrink_mx6nx8.png\"\n/>\n\nHistorically, monocropping has been the quickest route to starvation, pests, and famine. Don't be a lumper potato farmer while everyone else is sustainably intercropping.\n\n<Spacer size=\"small\" />\n\n### 6. Independent Ownership\n\nGardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control.\n\nThis patch should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (aka. also Facebook), or Medium. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Most of them actively fight against it.\n\nIf any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it (crazier things have happened in the span of humanity). None of them have an easy export button. And they certainly won't hand you your data in a transferable format.\n\n<img\n  width=\"880px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1000/v1622210536/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/interoperable_shrink_vmtvx6.png\"\n  alt=\"A set of walled gardens with the Twitter, Medium, and Facebook logos next to an open garden built on HTML, CSS, and Markdown\"\n/>\n\nIndependently owning your garden helps you plan for long-term change. You should think about how you want your space to grow over the next few decades, not just the next few months.\n\nIf you give it a bit of forethought, you can build your garden in a way that makes it easy to transfer and adapt. Platforms and technologies will inevitably change. Using old-school, reliable, and widely used web native formats like HTML/CSS is a safe bet. Backing up your notes as flat markdown files won't hurt either.\n\nKeeping your garden on the open web also sets you up to take part in the future of gardening. At the moment our gardens are rather solo affairs. We haven't figure out how to make them multi-player. _But_ there's an enthusiastic community of developers and designers trying to fix that. It's hard to say what kind of libraries, frameworks, and design patterns might emerge out of that effort, but it certainly isn't going to happen behind a Medium paywall.\n\n<img\n  width=\"920px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1000/v1622210536/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/shared-gardens_shrink_xin7qm.png\"\n  alt=\"A set of gardens with plant life moving between them\"\n/>\n\n---\n\nThis is all my take on gardening, but knowledge and neologisms always live within communities. No one owns _The Official Definition_ of digital gardening. Numerous people have contributed to the growing conversation and you should read their thoughts as well.\n\n<References>\n\n<ReferencesLink\n  title=\"The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral\n\"\n  author=\"Mike Caulfield\"\n  href=\"https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/\"\n/>\n\n<ReferencesLink\n  title=\"My blog is a digital garden, not a blog\"\n  author=\"Joel Hooks\"\n  href=\"https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden\"\n/>\n\n<ReferencesLink\n  title=\"Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens\n\"\n  author=\"Tom Critchlow\"\n  href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/\"\n/>\n\n<ReferencesLink\n  title=\"How the Blog Broke the Web\"\n  author=\"Amy Hoy\"\n  href=\"https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/\"\n/>\n\n<ReferencesLink\n  title=\"You and your mind garden\"\n  author=\"Anne-Laure Le Cunff\"\n  href=\"https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden\"\n/>\n\n<ReferencesLink\n  title=\"Digital Gardening Terms of Service\"\n  author=\"Shawn Wang\"\n  href=\"https://www.swyx.io/writing/digital-garden-tos/\"\n/>\n\n<ReferencesLink\n  title=\"The Future of MDX and Digital Gardening Panel\"\n  author=\"Joel Hooks, Chris Biscardi, John Otander, and Kurt Kemple\"\n  href=\"https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-sector-the-future-of-mdx-and-digital-gardens\"\n/>\n\n</References>\n","data":{"title":"A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden","description":"A newly revived philosophy for publishing personal knowledge on the web","aliases":["Digital Gardeners","Digital Gardening","Digital Gardens","Digital Garden","digital gardens","History and Ethos of Digital Gardening","garden"],"startDate":"2020-06-10","updated":"2021-05-28","featured":true,"toc":true,"cover":"/images/covers/garden-cover@2x.png","type":"essay","topics":["Digital Gardening","The Web","Personal Knowledge"],"growthStage":"evergreen"},"slug":"garden-history","filePath":"garden-history.mdx"},{"content":"\n<IntroParagraph>\n\nWith the recent rise of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), the idea of bi-directional linking is having a bit of a moment.\n\n</IntroParagraph>\n\nWe're all very used to the _mono-directional_ link the World Wide Web is built around. They act as one-way pointers we follow in a linear sequence.\n\nWhile we can link to any site, the destination page hasn't a clue we've done so.\n\nWe set up all these single-direction paths, trying to signal relevance and context, only to have the other side completely ignore our efforts.\n\nOur monolinks are trying to establish relationships in vain.\n\n<BasicImage\n  width=\"950px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1589455927/maggieappleton.com/notes/Hyperlinks.png\"\n/>\n\nWe're starting to look around our mono-linked environment and wonder why it's so hard to surface relevant contextual relationships.\n\nManually interlinking content takes an awful lot of human curation and effort.

He wanted a system capable of ‚Äúassociative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... [so that] numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail.‚Äù\n\nThis essay turned out to be a foundational document for the ideologies that directly led to both the internet and the Web. <Footnote idName={1}>Yes, those are two entirely separate pieces of technology.</Footnote> Vannevar was one of the key movers and shakers rallying folks to help build the original internet infrastructure. He corraled folks at MIT, the US Department of Defence, the National Science Foundation and various research labs like the Standford Lincoln Lab, Bell Labs, the RAND Corporation, and Xerox PARC to get involved. <Footnote idName={2}>Walter Isaacson, [The Innovators](https://www.librarything.com/work/15179823): How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution (London: Simon & Schuster, 2015).</Footnote>\n\nSuffice to say, the guy was driven by a belief that enabling people to connect information and share knowledge would expand the scope of human understanding. The Memex was one idea of how that might manifest in material form.\n\n<br />\n\n<BasicImage\n  showalt\n  alt=\"Vannevar even created a small informative diagram of this desk-bound vision. Marketing chops 101.\"\n  width=\"800px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1589545798/maggieappleton.com/notes/memex.jpg\"\n/>\n\nVannevar's evocative description of the Memex is especially impressive given that digital computers had only come into existence 5 years earlier. Most were still the domain of large military operations like Bletchley Park, and were seen as inconveniently large calculators.\n\nImplementing a wildly interactive computational personal knowledge base wasn't much of an option.\n\nSo the idea went into hiberation and didn't resurface until the idea of personal computing began blooming in the sixties and seventies. [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson), an unlikely film director and sociologist, stumbled into a series of computing lectures and began to imagine how graphical interfaces might reinvent the way we write and connect ideas. He took inspiration directly from Vannevar's essay, and in 1965 when he coined the term _hypertext_ to describe his vision for a sprawling network of interlinking information.\n\nNelson planned to implement these hypertextual dreams in his perpetually-imminent Project Xanadu. <Footnote idName={3}>If you have some time, this is quite the internet history [rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) to run down. Ted Nelson is on [another level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0NgV3yNd2o).</Footnote>\n\nThe Xanadu project was a hypertext system that imagined that every sentence, block, and page would be part of a vast bi-directionally linked network.\n\n<br />\n\n<ImageFrame\n  showalt\n  alt=\"A design mockup of how Project Xanadu might visually connect pieces of text across multiple documents\"\n  width=\"1050px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1589545780/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu.png\"\n/>\n\n<Center><img\n  width=\"100px\"\n  alt=\"fleshed emoji face\"\n  src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/237/flushed-face_1f633.png\"\n/></Center>\n\nYou'd be able to trace information back to its origin the way current web links do. But you'd also be able to see who had referenced, remixed, and expanded off that original. The full [[Pattern Language of Project Xanadu]] expands far beyond just bi-directional links to include features like [[Transclusions]], but we won't dive into it all here.\n\nSuffice it to say, Xanadu didn't pan out.\n\nInstead, we got the less fancy, but far more real and useable World Wide Web that currently does not support bi-directionals on an infrastructure level.\n\nWhile Sir Tim Berner's Lee [wrote himself a note](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html) debating their pros and cons back in 1999, there is an obvious design issue with letting two-way connections flow freely around the web.\n\nIf _every_ site that linked to yours was visible on your page, and you had no control over who could and couldn't link to you, it is not hard to imagine the Trollish implications...\n\nFiguring out how we might filter, moderate, and set permissions around link visibility turned into [quite the challenge](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74236). The [design details](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74229) [grew complex](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74245).\n\nIt became clear implementing the Web with simpler mono-directional links was the right thing to do, given that its creators wanted universal adoption. Lots of people are still mad about it. Let's not venture too far down that historical wormhole.\n\n> **The TLDR is technology is hard**.\n\nUntil [Xanadu ships](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/) and we're all immersed in the universe of multi-linked, version-controlled nodes of remixable micro-content (that somehow solves the problems of permissions and moderation), there are still plenty of ways we can resurrect the possibility of bi-directional links on the web.\n\n---\n\n## Bi-direction Linking in Personal Digital Gardens\n\nMost of the design issues with adding bi-directional links to the global web were related to moderation and permissions. However, adding them within the bounds of a single website with one author sidesteps that problem.\n\nThere's been a flurry of interest around bi-directionals among people involved in the [[Digital Gardening]] movement.\n\nMuch of this was originally sparked by <a href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/\">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. Go have a good browse through them.\n\n<ImageFrame\n  showalt\n  alt=\"Andy's linked notes stack on top of one another, allowing you to browse to new notes while previous notes are still visible\"\n  width=\"1050px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1589545795/maggieappleton.com/notes/andy-note-links.png\"\n/>\n\n<Spacer size=\"small\" />\n\n\nThere's plenty to admire here.<Footnote idName={4}>It should be noted Andy is an experienced developer and interaction\ndesigner, and these notes should not be taken as the standard expectation\nfor the rest of us normal plebby internet citizens.</Footnote> But the key part of this system that creates interlinked context is\nthe **\"Links to this Note\"** section at the bottom of each post.\n\n\nAnytime Andy links to another one of their notes on the site, it'll pop up as a related note at the bottom of the page. This is the bi-directional dream.\n\n<BasicImage\n  width=\"1050px\"\n  src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1589483829/maggieappleton.com/notes/Hyperlinks_3.png\"\n/>\n\nIt gives us a way to navigate through these ideas in exploratory mode, rather than navigating a hierarchy of categories on a main index page.\n\nSince it's all contained within a single-author site, our Spammish-Troll-risk factor is at a comfortable zero. <Footnote idName={5}>This is mildly tangential, but I love how the topic of bi-directional links\nmakes fully visible our ‚Äúwebsites are locations‚Äù and ‚Äúwebsites are\ncontainers‚Äù conceptual metaphors with **\"inside\"** and **\"outside\"**\nlinks.</Footnote>\n\n---\n\n### Building Your Own Bi-Directionals\n\nThat's all very cool, but how are you supposed to build bi-directionals into your own site? Thankfully, setting up your own public gardening bi-directional Memex doesn't involve Xanadu.\n\nOne fantastic option for non-developers is based around a personal wiki system called [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/). Anne-Laure Le Cunff wrote up an easy-to-follow guide to getting [your own up and running](https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-beginner-tutorial).\n\nFor those of us here for the hyper-customised, over-engineered JavaScript solution (that would be me üôå), the [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) community has a number of active gardening enthusiasts building themes and plugins.\n\nI built mine using Aengus McMillin's [gatsby-theme-brain](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain). Aengus has documented the theme well and it's not too challenging to implement (as long as you're comfortable in JavaScript and React).\n\nI also curate a list of tools for [[Digital Gardening]] on this [Github repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners/)\n\n---\n\n### Bi-Directional Linking with WebMentions\n\nWhile I argued that Web-wide bi-directional links are unlikely to happen at a global scale, there's a way you can add bi-directionals to your personal website that picks up on references anywhere on the web.\n\n[WebMentions](https://webmention.io/) are a piece of web infrastructure the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community has done a lot of work to advocate for. The W3C gave the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) _recommendation_ status in 2017.\n\nThe system notifies a URL whenever that site is mentioned elsewhere on the web. You're then able to show that mention and its contents on your site. It's essentially an opt-in bi-directional linking system.\n\nPlenty of folks have written useful guides on how to add these to your site. Here's one for any [static site](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2019/02/adding-webmention-support-to-a-static-site/), one for [Gatsby](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/building-gatsby-plugin-webmentions), one for [Next.js](https://css-tricks.com/jumping-into-webmentions-with-nextjs-or-not/). There's a whole list of implementation examples on the [IndieWeb Wiki](https://indieweb.org/Webmention#IndieWeb_Examples) you can look through.\n","data":{"title":"A Short History of Bi-Directional Links","description":"Seventy years ago we dreamed up links that would allow us to create two-way, contextual conversations.

However, the benefits are not always as they seem, and economic policies is\r\n\t\tnot entirely what makes the union as successful as it is.\r\n</IntroParagraph >\r\n\r\n<ResponsiveImage\r\n\t\twidth = \"1000px\"\r\n\t\talt = \"An illustration of layers of the web: the dark forest on top, followed by layers of cozyweb holes where people hide away from bots and ad scavengers\"\r\n\t\tsrc = \"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/cozyweb.png\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## The View\r\nAs it is the case with all forms of jingoistic post hoc rationalizing, and strategically obfuscating phraseology, under the terms coined and spread by the leaders of modern Western Economic Neoliberal Thought, there is a persistent conscious effort to mislead the public into believing that the benefits of EU membership are equally beneficial to all parties involved. Moreover, that any thing that objectively benefits the interests of a tiny minority of people, is also in your best interest.\r\n\r\nThis entire concept has become a prevailing myth that provides a much-needed ounce of plausible deniability for those who are skeptical of the West‚Äôs motivations globally, as well as domestically.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Reality\r\nThe benefits of EU membership are not solely economic in nature, and it most certainly doesn't benefit all participants equally. The real lure of membership comes in 2 forms.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is felt though the EU‚Äôs unique offer of safety. It‚Äôs a normal gesture made more special by the fact that the safety sought after is from your proposed allies and not your foes; and it is made even more fascinating in the fact that this offer of safety still doesn‚Äôt guarantee you will not be fucked over, evidently. It‚Äôs an oddity that is revealed more and more as the years go by and information is made public. Furthermore, it is experienced in ‚Äútragedies,‚Äù like Italy‚Äôs Years of Lead. The consequence of purely Western policy that I‚Äôd say could only be imagined by the unmatched talents of those types of individuals well attuned to the brutality unleashed by their forefathers throughout their colonial roots. It‚Äôs a cultural expression exposed to be unadulterated terrorist campaigns entirely manned and led by right-wing neo-fascist deathsquads, assets of the United States, and the key nations staffing NATO.\r\n\r\nThe second benefit is the allowances, granted by the hegemonic might of Europe's guard dog embodied in the United States, to wage and benefit from our neo-colonial wars of conquest against everyone else deemed fair game by the mere reality of not being born part of our select group of unbound privilege (but maybe not unbound any longer, god willing).\r\n\r\nI know that sounds like a distinction without a difference, but I‚Äôm not talking about the bullshit, neoliberal, empty pandering we are accustomed too domestically. I‚Äôm talking about the sort of monstrous shit our white, billionaire, feudal lords feel they can openly brag about.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs the type of political power that gives President Emmanuel Macron the audacity to make insane claims about Russia being¬† 'one of the last imperial colonial powers,‚Äô to Africans, during his tour of the, more than 8, African nations France controls the national currencies and resources of.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs a sense of authority that allows American neo-fascist war criminals to, essentially, brag about and defend their murders on national TV. And continue to live out their, way too long, lives getting praised by the western foreign policy blob and media apparatus, who to deserve their day before a firing squad.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs the mentality that allows us to so cynically bemoan the injustices of nations like China when they‚Äôre shown to have the gall to start beating us at a game we rigged to never lose. We start screaming out for Democracy, and Human Rights, at our manufactured enemies while at the same time letting our closest ally, a human rights champion run the world's largest open-air prison on the population they are trying to genocide; one sniper shot in the face, or the knee, at a time.\r\n","data":{"title":"The Development of the EU","description":"Why have so many countries worked so hard to join the EU?

This was a fact perfectly expressed by the man who would later become the Education advisor for both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, Roger A. Freeman.\n\n## The History\nIn the San Francisco Chronicle, Freeman stated:\n‚ÄúWe are in danger of producing an educated proletariat. That's dynamite. We have to be selective on whom we allow to go through higher education.‚Äù\n\nFreeman and Reagan both knew that the more educated the public was, the more likely they were to question the authority of leaders both politically, and of American industry, and the more likely they were to question the way power is distributed. It was understood that, contrary to the popular belief in meritocracy under American capitalism, we live under a system that is molded to benefit the few already powerful enough to impose it. It was understood that, in reality, a true meritocracy would be a system that these powerful interest groups create by old money WASP's, new-age ‚ÄúAmerican Royalty‚Äù comprised of billionaire tech oligarchs, and other wealthy elites, may not be able to maintain control on their merits alone.\n\nJust like our public education institutions, the healthcare industry is a major form of leverage in the American economy, meant to control the one factor of production that is most independent of the market and direct capital control, and that is the human body.\nTake for example the notion that you need to attend university to get a good job, and experience the possibility of some sort of generational upward mobility. So, you need to go to university, but before that you need to accept a massive amount of debt in order to even make that realistically possible if you're not already wealthy through generational ties.\nMoving on, you're now educated enough to get a good job, but you can't be too picky; you need to start paying off your debt as soon as possible. Now you have a decent paying job, but you don't like the way you're treated at work. Let's say you're being sexually harassed by your boss, or like in the case of tech workers under Elon Musk, you experience a racially hostile work environment.\n\nIn America, we tell you that you have the freedom to quit, but that doesn‚Äôt take into account the fact that your healthcare is tied to your employer. Can you afford the healthcare premiums from your provider on your own if your employment status subsidizes the cost? Or maybe your employer is technically your provider, and without your current employer you lose your healthcare and access to your doctor altogether. So, what do you do? Would you even be able to speak up about your experience knowing that you would be risking your job, your healthcare, and consequently, your life if the company you work for inevitably decides to retaliate against you?\n\nThe American healthcare system is just another extension of our control system. It's a system that philosopher Gilles Deleuze termed, ‚ÄúSocieties of Control‚Äù. It's a concept that attempts to explain how these facets of American society, like a seemingly dysfunctional privatized healthcare industry, in our neoliberal economic system, work as intentional tools of passive control operating under the mask of individual freedom. Furthermore, it works as a system that offers you an illusion of choice, by hiding the enforcement mechanisms behind our self-regulation of behavior, and the limiting of viable options through nearly invisible austerity measures and consolidation.\n\n\n## Citations\n","data":{"title":"Comparative Healthcare","description":" ","growthStage":"budding","startDate":"2023-03-08","updated":"2023-03-08","type":"essay","topics":["Politics","Healthcare","USA","Domestic Policy","Capitalism"]},"slug":"comparative-healthcare","filePath":"comparative-healthcare.mdx"},{"content":"\n## Illustrations & art direction for Kent C.
