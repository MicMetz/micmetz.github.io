However, the benefits are not always as they seem, and economic policies is\r\n\t\tnot entirely what makes the union as successful as it is.\r\n</IntroParagraph >\r\n\r\n<ResponsiveImage\r\n\t\twidth = \"1000px\"\r\n\t\talt = \"An illustration of layers of the web: the dark forest on top, followed by layers of cozyweb holes where people hide away from bots and ad scavengers\"\r\n\t\tsrc = \"/images/posts/ai-dark-forest/cozyweb.png\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## The View\r\nAs it is the case with all forms of jingoistic post hoc rationalizing, and strategically obfuscating phraseology, under the terms coined and spread by the leaders of modern Western Economic Neoliberal Thought, there is a persistent conscious effort to mislead the public into believing that the benefits of EU membership are equally beneficial to all parties involved. Moreover, that any thing that objectively benefits the interests of a tiny minority of people, is also in your best interest.\r\n\r\nThis entire concept has become a prevailing myth that provides a much-needed ounce of plausible deniability for those who are skeptical of the West’s motivations globally, as well as domestically.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Reality\r\nThe benefits of EU membership are not solely economic in nature, and it most certainly doesn't benefit all participants equally. The real lure of membership comes in 2 forms.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is felt though the EU’s unique offer of safety. It’s a normal gesture made more special by the fact that the safety sought after is from your proposed allies and not your foes; and it is made even more fascinating in the fact that this offer of safety still doesn’t guarantee you will not be fucked over, evidently. It’s an oddity that is revealed more and more as the years go by and information is made public. Furthermore, it is experienced in “tragedies,” like Italy’s Years of Lead. The consequence of purely Western policy that I’d say could only be imagined by the unmatched talents of those types of individuals well attuned to the brutality unleashed by their forefathers throughout their colonial roots. It’s a cultural expression exposed to be unadulterated terrorist campaigns entirely manned and led by right-wing neo-fascist deathsquads, assets of the United States, and the key nations staffing NATO.\r\n\r\nThe second benefit is the allowances, granted by the hegemonic might of Europe's guard dog embodied in the United States, to wage and benefit from our neo-colonial wars of conquest against everyone else deemed fair game by the mere reality of not being born part of our select group of unbound privilege (but maybe not unbound any longer, god willing).\r\n\r\nI know that sounds like a distinction without a difference, but I’m not talking about the bullshit, neoliberal, empty pandering we are accustomed too domestically. I’m talking about the sort of monstrous shit our white, billionaire, feudal lords feel they can openly brag about.\r\n\r\nIt’s the type of political power that gives President Emmanuel Macron the audacity to make insane claims about Russia being  'one of the last imperial colonial powers,’ to Africans, during his tour of the, more than 8, African nations France controls the national currencies and resources of.\r\n\r\nIt’s a sense of authority that allows American neo-fascist war criminals to, essentially, brag about and defend their murders on national TV. And continue to live out their, way too long, lives getting praised by the western foreign policy blob and media apparatus, who to deserve their day before a firing squad.\r\n\r\nIt’s the mentality that allows us to so cynically bemoan the injustices of nations like China when they’re shown to have the gall to start beating us at a game we rigged to never lose. We start screaming out for Democracy, and Human Rights, at our manufactured enemies while at the same time letting our closest ally, a human rights champion run the world's largest open-air prison on the population they are trying to genocide; one sniper shot in the face, or the knee, at a time.\r\n","data":{"title":"The Development of the EU","description":"Why have so many countries worked so hard to join the EU?

I'm unavailable for any contract, side-project, or full-time roles for the forseeable future. I'll post on Twitter and update this status if the situation ever changes.\n\n</SimpleCard >\n\n<SimpleCard alignLeft >\n\n\t\t### Do you consider yourself a designer or developer?\n\n\t\tBoth. I find the distinction between the two fields necessary on the macro scale of our whole industry, but fairly irrelevant on the micro scale of an individual making things in the world.\n\n\t\tI starting learning HTML at 12 because I wanted to figure out how to layout a bunch of Neopets images in a table format. Development skills have always been a necessary tool in my design process.\n\t\tYou can't divorce the creation from the medium.\n\n</SimpleCard >\n\n<SimpleCard alignLeft >\n\n\t\t### What tools do you use to illustrate?\n\n\t\tPrimarily my brain and upper body limbs. With a little help from [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) on an iPad Pro. I do a little color and brightness editing in Photoshop as well, but it's a\n\t\tpretty minor step.\n\n\t\tI'm betting want more information than that, so I wrote a whole post called [[What App is That?]] for you.\n\n</SimpleCard >\n\n<SimpleCard alignLeft >\n\n\t\t### Do you have any resources or advice for someone who wants to get started with making illustrations?\n\n\t\tPlenty.\n\t\tHave a look at the [Resources](/resources) page for a collection of courses, learning platforms, and books I personally recommend.\n\n\t\tYou might also want to read my essay series on [[Drawing Invisible Programming Concepts]]\n\n\t\tThat said, I no longer work as an illustrator. I spent four years working professionally in illustration (2015-2019) before moving into an art direction and product design role. I'm not a great\n\t\tsource of advice on 'making it' as an illustrator, since that's not something I want to do.\n\n</SimpleCard >\n\n<SimpleCard alignLeft >\n\n\t\t### I want prints of your illustrations. Can I buy prints from you or print them myself?\n\n\t\tYou can indeed print any images you find here for your own personal use!\n\n\t\tThe image quality on the garden notes and twitter is low for printing (72dpi). But if you join my email list I send out high-quality, downloadable versions on there (300dpi – big enough to print on\n\t\tthe side of a wall if you so desire).\n\n\t\tI'm not fan of the carbon emissions involved in printing, storing, and shipping these from a central location. So if you want professional prints I suggest finding a local printer near you and\n\t\tsending them the high-res files.\n\n</SimpleCard >\n\n<SimpleCard alignLeft >\n\n\t\t### How would you describe your work?\n\n\t\tI think about this too much, but I would shelve everything I do under the banner of **visual explanations**. This conveniently vague term includes everything from **illustrated notes and essays** to\n\t\t**interface design**.\n\n\t\tWhat I don't make:\n\n\t\t- **Comics** - Comics tell a narrative story over time. I mostly explain non-narrative topics and explore ideas atemporarily out of time. They share a lot of comic-like qualities though, and I've\n\t\tspent countless hours studying & stealing techniques from comic artists like [Will Eisner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Eisner), [Nick Sousanis](http://spinweaveandcut.com/), and [Scott\n\t\tMcCloud](http://scottmccloud.com/).\n\t\t- **Infographics** - Infographics have [a particular aesthetic](https://www.pinterest.com/vectorstock/infographic-templates/) that makes my eyes bleed. While technically these do communicate\n\t\tinformation through graphics, the word _infographic_ comes with visual baggage. And I would like to run very, very far away from it.\n\t\t- **Sketchnotes** - If we define 'sketchnotes' as true _sketches_ – unrefined, unplanned visual scribbles – my work doesn't fit.\n\t\tThey're far more crafted and planned than stream-of-consciousness sketches drawn in one fell swoop.\n\n</SimpleCard >\n\n### Have a question I haven't answered?\n\n[Feel free to ask me on twitter](https://twitter.com/mappletons)\n","data":{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions","description":"Questions I am often asked to answer","updated":"2021-12-22","startDate":"2020-06-27","type":"note","topics":["How to Illustrate","Design"],"aliases":["frequently ask","FAQ"],"growthStage":"seedling"},"slug":"FAQ","filePath":"FAQ.mdx"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
