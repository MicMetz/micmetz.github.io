## Introduction
<IntroParagraph >
  <strong >Our Real Task</strong > is a short educational project to help us understand the history of the United States and its reorganizing of the world after World War II.
  <Spacer />
  The project is a web application that attempts to raise questions about the role of the United States in the world. It's my attempt to provide a different
  perspective on the history of the United States that contrasts with the one we are taught in school, and expected to believe throughout our lives.
