## Illustrations & art direction for Kent C. Dodd's [Testing JavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/) course


## Module Illustrations

The course included eight modules that each needed an individual illustration. To make sure they all felt like a unified set, I established a common colour palette, and consistent shape language.
