<ListNumber number="1" title="Silicon">
  Silicon is the most common semiconductor material used in microchip fabrication. It is a metalloid, meaning it has properties of both metals and non-metals.
  It is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen. It is found in sand, quartz, and other minerals.
