<h2 >Introduction</h2 >
<IntroParagraph >
  American politicians are more concerned with not alienating the financial interest of healthcare groups because undermining them will inadvertently undermine the structure of our labor market, and
  subsequently, the power granted to American capital as a whole.
</IntroParagraph >

Stated most bluntly, It's all about defending our economic system, which itself, inherently, is based on the allocation of resources and the power wielded by those who control the most of those
resources, or at least the representation of that wealth in the form of currency. Over 50 years ago, American public universities were cheaper to attend than they are today, and that was seen as a
threat to our economic system. This was a fact perfectly expressed by the man who would later become the Education advisor for both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, Roger A. Freeman.

<h2 >The History</h2 >
In the San Francisco Chronicle, Freeman stated:
“We are in danger of producing an educated proletariat. That's dynamite. We have to be selective on whom we allow to go through higher education.”

Freeman and Reagan both knew that the more educated the public was, the more likely they were to question the authority of leaders both politically, and of American industry, and the more likely
they were to question the way power is distributed. It was understood that, contrary to the popular belief in meritocracy under American capitalism, we live under a system that is molded to
benefit the few already powerful enough to impose it. It was understood that, in reality, a true meritocracy would be a system that these powerful interest groups create by old money WASP's,
new-age “American Royalty” comprised of billionaire tech oligarchs, and other wealthy elites, may not be able to maintain control on their merits alone.

<h2 >The Reality</h2 >
Just like our public education institutions, the healthcare industry is a major form of leverage in the American economy, meant to control the one factor of production that is most independent of
the market and direct capital control, and that is the human body. Take for example the notion that you need to attend university to get a good job, and experience the possibility of some sort of
generational upward mobility. So, you need to go to university, but before that you need to accept a massive amount of debt in order to even make that realistically possible if you're not already
wealthy through generational ties. Moving on, you're now educated enough to get a good job, but you can't be too picky; you need to start paying off your debt as soon as possible. Now you have a
decent paying job, but you don't like the way you're treated at work. Let's say you're being sexually harassed by your boss, or like in the case of tech workers under Elon Musk, you experience a
racially hostile work environment.

In America, we tell you that you have the freedom to quit, but that doesn’t take into account the fact that your healthcare is tied to your employer. Can you afford the healthcare premiums from
your provider on your own if your employment status subsidizes the cost? Or maybe your employer is technically your provider, and without your current employer you lose your healthcare and
access to your doctor altogether. So, what do you do? Would you even be able to speak up about your experience knowing that you would be risking your job, your healthcare, and consequently, your
life if the company you work for inevitably decides to retaliate against you?

The American healthcare system is just another extension of our control system. It's a system that philosopher Gilles Deleuze termed, “Societies of Control”. It's a concept that attempts to
explain how these facets of American society, like a seemingly dysfunctional privatized healthcare industry, in our neoliberal economic system, work as intentional tools of passive control
operating under the mask of individual freedom. Furthermore, it works as a system that offers you an illusion of choice, by hiding the enforcement mechanisms behind our self-regulation of
behavior, and the limiting of viable options through nearly invisible austerity measures and consolidation.
