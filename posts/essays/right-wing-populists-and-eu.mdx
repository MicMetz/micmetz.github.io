<IntroParagraph >
  There is a quote that is frequently repeated by American right-wing media personalities.
  <br />
  The quote, by a conservative author, Michael Hopf, is as follows: 'Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times.'
  <br />
  The phrase has become a sort of mantra for the far-right in the United States. It has been used as a catch-all indictment of the current, deteriorating state of the American quality of life. It is
  used to explain the lack of quality jobs, the lack of interpersonal relationships in the form of new families and community, and the general lacking of a sense of purpose or belonging that comes
  as a result.
  <br />
  The quote perfectly encapsulates the thinking of the reactionary conservative. It's a call to return to “better times.” And in the United States, under the leadership of Donald Trump, it was a
  demand to make America great again.
  <br />
  However, the message, when used by the far-right, is often accompanied by the subtle insinuation that the degradation of society is an intentional act by some nefarious group. A terror cell, of
  sorts, that is working to destroy the fabric of society. And this isn't just a theory unique to American reactionaries. The Deutsche Welle documentary shows how this reactionary sentiment has
  effectively taken hold in Europe.
