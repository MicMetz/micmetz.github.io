  <IntroParagraph >
    After the Democratic Party won a majority of the seats of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, the American people watched and waited for troops deployed to Iraq to slowly start
    rotating out, and sent on track to return home. It was a goal the Democrats campaigned on. However, their goals quickly changed.
  </IntroParagraph >

  With the government of Saddam collapsed, and [the war having been won](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mission-accomplished-whodunit/), the Bush Administration proposes a shift in policy towards
  “security,” and a bipartisan Congress signs on to send another 20,000 soldiers to war. The Western Coalition’s troop surge has been met with a more determined insurgent force. The result of which
  is a significant increase in the frequency of Coalition ground troops receiving direct
  small arms fires through ambushes. To combat this, a new strategy of having helicopters provide security to ground troops and their convoys was devised and put into standard practice.



  The day is July 12th, 2007, it’s noon in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad. Reuters journalists, Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh, were interviewing the civilians attempting to live in the area.


  While Saeed answered a call on his cellphone, Namir took a photo of a humvee nearby around the corner of a residential building. Namir and the crowd of locals surrounding him turn from the corner
  to continue down their path, but then dirt starts shooting up from the ground beneath them. In an instant, the men all scatter.



  At least 1200 meters away and 1000 meters up, two American AH-64 Apache helicopters are requesting permission to fire upon a group of men gathered on a main road with AK-47s and an RPG. The
  pilots are given the go ahead to fire.



  Chmagh is fatally wounded, but manages to leap out of the way of direct incoming fire. Multiple locals are lost, completely engulfed by the smoke-like dust produced by the attack helicopter’s
  30mm round. A projectile as long as a man’s forearm. The round is designed as an anti-material munition. Completely overkill for personnel, but with the Iraqi army of Saddam having long been
  dissolved, there
  isn’t much armor to contend with from a far weaker insurgent force.



  Namir sprints off and out of the helicopter's direct fire, but falls not moments later. Separated from the killzone, but still alive, the Apache gunner singles out Namir. Namir is then bifurcated
  from the waist down. His foot is the last the world sees of him, flung high in the air as the gunner scans off to engage further targets.



  Later that night the Department of Defense (DoD) reported, “Firefight in New Baghdad. US, Iraqi forces kill 9 insurgents, detain 13.” Continuing they said, “and two civilians were killed during
  the firefight.”



  Months after the incident, in a closed door meeting with military officials, Iraq bureau chief for Reuters, Dean Yates, was given a story of half truths, and set on his way. It wasn’t until 3
  years later, when the full length video was leaked by Chelsea Manning, and reported on by Wikileaks, that the world learned of
  [what truly transpired](https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/1248069533084/collateral-murder.html).



  The leaked video from the Apache helicopters, WikiLeaks titled, “Collateral Murder,” included audio of the orders, requests, and statements relayed back and forth between the 4 pilots, and their
  operating base. Although the DoD as well as some media agencies made [attempts to downplay](https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2010/04/the-lies-of-the-pentagon-ctd/188500/) or muddy
  the public's perspective by inserting the possibility [there were weapons present nearby](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/04/video_of_errant_us_shootings_o.html), the audio painted a
  damning narrative, and exemplified the level of disdain the Airmen have towards the Iraqis. If not for the whistleblower, Chelsea Manning, the truth behind the killing of the two Reuters
  journalists would have never been revealed. However, to people critical of the American state, this
  reveal only presented further questions. The reasons, some, including myself, argue that this murder and coverup was uncovered was because of a whistleblower that knew where to look, and because
  of who two of the victims were. Would reactions have been different if the victims were only locals? How many similar events have occurred over our 20 years of the war on terror, the victims
  smeared as “insurgents” killed in a “firefight,” or written off as collateral damage?



  Not a single article mentioned the other men in the crowd killed that day. Not a single article cared to even report their names. The media is and has always been a powerful tool. Which makes
  sense. The media is the delivery force of information, and information is the most effective mobilizing force when it’s openly
  available, and the most effective method of sedation when it’s taken away. Before the information age, a leak like the one Manning provided WikiLeaks might not have been as reachable to the
  public, as its reachability and ability to remain a relevant story was limited
  to the popularity of the platform it's published on. And With big name news agencies having policies in which they first check with government officials to ask if they would, in effect,
  [sign off on the publishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/reader-center/how-the-times-decides-when-to-publish-leaked-news.html) of the leaked information, there was no guarantee that the
  public would be properly informed whenever there is damning information involving their government. Social media changed all of that. Social media made it possible for anyone to set a narrative,
  and have it compete with the general consensus, whether it’s valid or not. Social media has revolutionized the way news can be
  distributed, as it has allowed independently funded agencies to publish, grow an audience, and self-fund themselves. However, social media, we are seeing, doesn’t just level the playing field
  between legacy and new media. It also can, and most certainly has, granted extremist propaganda an air of legitimacy.



  So, in effect, social media is not truly a new form of media. I would best describe social media as an amplifier of our traditional media tools. This fact has been displayed adequately with the
  Russo-Ukraine war.



  There are rare moments in life where you are given the opportunity to discover the truth of something you might have at one point in time thought unimaginable. For me, I always wondered how
  institutions and the general public would respond if the roles of modern warfare were reversed.



  How would we react to a European country being invaded by a larger military force similar to the actions we’ve justified in our recent history? How would Europe respond to this new group of war
  refugees enacting their rights to asylum, as opposed to their response to the last? How would the public tolerate imagery of the brutality inherent to war? Would they take those horrific scenes
  in stride? Just as they’ve done so in the past. Or would they be driven to demand retaliation? All of these questions were answered within the short 2 months directly following the invasion of
  Ukraine conducted by the Russian military.



  Once Russia started its invasion of Ukraine, February 24th, 2022, the western nations moved almost entirely in sync with one another to shift focus and resources towards boosting Ukraine’s
  military capabilities, while at the same time attempting to limit The Russian Federation’s financial capabilities. The western media turned up the gas, doing their best to drown out any attempt
  from Russia to spread propaganda by instead repeating propaganda spread by the Ukrainian government preparing for a siege in Kyiv. And the everyday people of Europe, and the North Americas in
  particular, joined in an effort to help prepare and receive the inevitable arrival of Ukrainian refugees. The quick unification of nation-states to join in opposing Russia, and denouncing the
  Russian government’s actions, as well as the level of solidarity demonstrated by citizens to aid their fellow
  man although strangers from foreign countries half the world away, was truly awe inspiring to witness. However, almost immediately an obvious ‘double standard’ started to become exposed. Everyone
  noticed it. People were asking questions about it. It’s just that no one was willing to address it. Any attempts to discuss the disparity being observed out in the open, and as clear as
  day was, at best, dismissed as not being important to the present moment in time, and in the worst case scenario, accused of being a false narrative spread by Russian
  [propagandists](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/open-door-die-africans-report-racism-hostility-trying-flee-ukraine-rcna17953). During the early stages of evacuation immediately after the
  Russian Federal Assembly recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as autonomous states, African and Indian students in Ukraine were
  [experiencing difficulties](https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/status/1498523427317112832?s=20&t=YuMefhFhgGFg8pNhybEvdw) as they were trying to evacuate with other eligible evacuees into Poland.
  Worst yet, ignoring the mounding evidence in the form of first hand recordings, all showing a consistently repeating experience where even CNN journalist, Bijan Hosseini’s sister
  [had shared](https://twitter.com/BijanCNN/status/1498692799939624962?s=20&t=fac1nEQKrYpjpbgba3llWg) in and documented, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement
  [denying the reality of all allegations](https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/do-not-be-misled-by-disinformation-ukraine-denies-reports-of-racism-against-africans-20220301).
  But this is not in the least bit surprising.



  Using twitter to help magnify the public's attention to focus on their mistreatment, African and Indian refugees got the help they needed. But the damage was already done. If it wasn’t clear
  enough from the sentiments shared on social media by common folk and media [professionals alike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3eDZean39s). The racial expectations, and hierarchy was laid bare,
  and no one even bothers to [pretend otherwise anymore](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/ukrainians-us-mexico-border-treatment).



  It used to be a meme that, compared to the Europeans our nation was birthed from, America was uniquely racist, uniquely homophobic, uniquely violent, and just uniquely “batshit crazy.” In just a
  few short years, the world has seen far-right, and even openly fascist movements have a sharp rise across Europe. Most of it seemingly started from years of war in the Middle East and Asia. And
  then things really approached climax during Europe’s, “[Refugee Crisis.](https://newrepublic.com/article/144954/return-fascism-germany-greece-far-right-nationalists-winning-elections)”
  However, the most important factor over all else, is exactly how and where these groups organized; they met online.



  if you have been paying attention to events in Ukraine for longer than the last 3 months they’ve been in direct war with Russia. Or, if you’ve seen Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
  [instagram](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1523715782772871168) in the last few days. Or, if you’ve seen any of their many propaganda
  [media shots](https://twitter.com/GettyImagesNews/status/1500491702880153604). You very likely are well familiarized with the Azov Battalion and what they stand for. The Azov Battalion is the
  notorious, openly neo-Nazi, national guard regiment, that has been officially
  [embedded into the Ukrainian national defense apparatus](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/azov-far-right-fighters-ukraine-neo-nazis) for at least 3 years now.



  Their integration was likely a strategic work-around for the group to continue receiving American funding. A work-around made necessity after Congress enacted a ban on any funds being directed to
  arm neo-nazi paramilitary groups abroad. However, the
  [Pentagon pressured Congress to repeal](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/congress-has-removed-a-ban-on-funding-neo-nazis-from-its-year-end-spending-bill/) that ban a little over a year
  later.



  The Azov Battalion is not the only devout neo-nazi military group in the Ukranian militaries ranks, nor does their existance justify Russia’s invasion. The significance of the Azov Battalion
  comes from the fact that America has directly funded them. Our Intelligence services, ‘allegedly,’
  [privately trained them](https://news.yahoo.com/cia-trained-ukrainian-paramilitaries-may-take-central-role-if-russia-invades-185258008.html).
  And the neo-nazi, far-right community worldwide idolizes them.



  The Azov Battalion have been far-right icons throughout online social media spaces. And as a result, they have been an integral part of recruiting individuals into their cause, and spreading
  their [white nationalist message.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiBXmbkwiSw)



  Just like how Chelsea Manning with WikiLeaks, Western media with Ukrainian propaganda, and black and brown refugees with their use of twitter and tiktok, The Azov Battalion and other white
  nationalist have effectively used social media to exponentially amplify their message and gain notoriety. The internet has always been a hotbed of a recruiting ground for far-right extremists. And
  the American’s state authorities as a whole, whether abetting or not, has played a lead role in this
  movement's growing influence. It would be insulting to recall events of the last 2 weeks, hell of the last 2 days, and still boldly deny this truth. The map above is a graphic representation of
  the UN’s Committee Adoption of the Combating Glorification of Nazism. America, Israel, and Ukraine have been the only 3 countries that I know of to
  vote against the resolution, every single year since it was proposed in 2014. The main reason given for regretting the proposal has been because of Russia being the country to propose it. However,
  the bill only asks that nations “condemn the glorification of Nazism and all
  forms of racism.” If anything, the resolution is purely symbolic. Yet still, we refused to sign it in the name of the United States Supreme court, "consistently affirmed the constitutional right
  to freedom of speech and the rights of peaceful assembly and association, , including by avowed Nazis, whose hatred and xenophobia are vile and widely scorned by the American people.” Social media
  is a tool to amplify traditional media tools and methods. Which, inherently, is not a horrible thing. However, in a country ranked a
  [backsliding democracy by international electoralpolicy institutes](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/01/1059896434/united-states-backsliding-democracy-donald-trump-january-6-capitol-attack).
  Which funds, trains, and then whitewashes neo-nazis we then use to fight our historic enemies instead of satisfying the need of it’s countrymen. And which enforces laws at the behest of a
  far-right evangelical minority given rulership over a majority. The far-right neo-nazis will be the smallest in numbers, but the loudest voices amplified and shouting over the crowd.



  The Azov Battalion have been the pinnacle of the neo-nazi movement for years. Online, through Discord servers, Facebook Groups, and the Twitter accounts of popular members of the movement, like
  minded individuals from anywhere in the world were offered opportunities to join their organization, get the best training the American and Canadian military could supply, and even get combat
  experience in the breakoff Donetsk region of Ukraine. Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the Christchurch mosque shooter was one of these individuals
  [given training by the Azov Battalion](https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/ukraine-raids-houses-of-neo-nazi-followers-of-christchurch-shooter-20200617-p553p8.html)
  (Identified as [Wotanjugend](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/09/04/the-hardcore-russian-neo-nazi-group-that-calls-ukraine-home/), a partner group whose members melded into
  Azov). Payton S.Gendron, an 18-year-old teenager from upstate NY, mentions how he was radicalized online through Discord, twitter, and Text Forms. His main influence was Brenton Harrison Tarrant,
  and
  his manifesto that Azov still reprints and distributes from their merch store. May 13th, 2022, Payton Gendron, fully radicalized under the neo-nazi propaganda doctrine of white genocide, also know
  as the “The White Replacement Theory,” decided to take matters into his own
  hands to protect the purity of the white race. He did so by finding a location where he could find the highest density of black people, gearing up in body armor, strapping on a helmet camera to
  live stream his sacrifice for whiteness, and going on a shooting spree.



  Ethan McCord, one of the retired pilots featured in the Collateral Murder leak, has left the Air Force. He gave an interview to radio podcast
  [The Takeaway,](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/188080-incident-new-baghdad-effects-war-soldier) on WNYC. In the interview he describes the remorse he has for what he’s
  done, but the main takeaway he wanted to get out to the audience was, what he’s done is what he was trained to do. The military never wanted to punish the pilots and the perpetrators of the
  likely countless other similar events that have occurred. This is the way the system is meant to function.
