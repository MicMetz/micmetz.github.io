<IntroParagraph >
  Following the end of the Second World War, there was no question that the order of the
  world was going to change. The United Kingdom was no longer the world power that it
  once was. The losses that the Kingdom suffered during the World War were too great for
  it to continue to maintain control over its colonial subjects now vying for independence.

  The United States of America, on the other hand, was in a unique position to take the place of
  the United Kingdom as the world power, and the United States of America did just that.
  The United States of America, in a sense, became the new United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom, under its Special Relationship with the United States, became a beneficiary of the United States of
  America's new position as a world power.

  Former Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, famously said, “One of the
  delightful things about Americans is that they have absolutely no historical memory.”

  The history of the United States of America is a particularly important subject of
  study, because the United States of America is a world power, and since the ending of the Cold War, the only world power. And with such power, the United States has expressed a desire in spreading
  its values and norms to the rest of the world, similar to how the United Kingdom did throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

  To understand the issues the United States of America faces, and how international conflicts form, one must understand the United Kingdom. The partnership between the two countries. The history of
  the partnerships the two countries have had with the wider Western world, and how Western American democracy takes shape throughout the globe.
