<IntroParagraph >
  The collapse of SVB and Credit Suisse has brought to the and Credit Suisse has brought to the surface the insolvent foundation on which the American tech sector is built.
  The Tech Industry is an industry that doesn't, and can't, survive absent the fact that we've, since the Subprime mortgage scandal, have been living with artificially low interest rates.
  Meaning, the Tech Industry is a sector propped up by <q >funny money</q > and under <q >normal</q > economic conditions would not exist at all in the way we've come to understand.
</IntroParagraph >


If you were to consider the Silicon Valley Tech Industry as a bubble, Silicon Valley Bank was the pump that supplied it with air.

In an industry composed of leaders such as Uber, who are incapable of producing a profit. And companies whose only value is due to the speculations of angel investors hoping to one day luck
themselves into owning a monopoly. A private money funneling engine like Silicon Valley Bank is a necessary function.

A traditional bank is not going to throw millions of dollars at a startup, that will never produce a material good, in the hopes that it may corner a future market. The entire ecosystem consists
of companies that would never have gotten a loan from, let&apos;s say, Bank of America, whom would never fund the pitch from a guy promising to create the Grubhub of dog walking.
