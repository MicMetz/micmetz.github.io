<h2 >Introduction</h2 >
<IntroParagraph >
  The United States of America has been in a state of war for the majority of its existence, but rarely has the country been in a direct conflict with a nation that is a peer competitor, and certainly
  not in modern times with modern capabilities.
  <Spacer />
  The last time the US was under threat of conflict with a peer competitor was during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union was never a direct threat to the United States of
  America, and the two countries never engaged in direct conflict.
  <Spacer />
  The Soviet Union never expanded its influence beyond its sphere of influence. The Cold War strategy of containment was successful, but not aimed at the Soviet Union, per se, but at the spreading of
  ideas that the Soviet Union represented, or any other ideas that might challenge the values and norms shared by the US, UK, and core of influence.
  <Spacer />
  This historical reality may help explain why the exponential ascension of China to the status of regional power was unexpected, and is now of major concern to the United States. However, China's
  rise to prominence, and the threat it poses to US hegemony, is the fault of the US itself, and It's policies that prioritize the wellbeing of capitalist interests-private property and a perpetual
  growth imperative-over the betterment of the lives of the laboring public.
