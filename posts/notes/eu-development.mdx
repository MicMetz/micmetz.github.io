## The Issue
The one aspect that everyone often mentions in having attributed to the allure of EU membership is the economic benefits. However, the benefits are not always as they seem, and economic policies is
not entirely what makes the union as successful as it is.


## The View
As it is the case with all forms of jingoistic post hoc rationalizing, and strategically obfuscating phraseology, under the terms coined and spread by the leaders of modern Western Economic Neoliberal Thought, there is a persistent conscious effort to mislead the public into believing that the benefits of EU membership are equally beneficial to all parties involved. Moreover, that any thing that objectively benefits the interests of a tiny minority of people, is also in your best interest.

This entire concept has become a prevailing myth that provides a much-needed ounce of plausible deniability for those who are skeptical of the West’s motivations globally, as well as domestically.


## The Reality
The benefits of EU membership are not solely economic in nature, and it most certainly doesn't benefit all participants equally. The real lure of membership comes in 2 forms.

Firstly, it is felt though the EU’s unique offer of safety. It’s a normal gesture made more special by the fact that the safety sought after is from your proposed allies and not your foes; and it is made even more fascinating in the fact that this offer of safety still doesn’t guarantee you will not be fucked over, evidently. It’s an oddity that is revealed more and more as the years go by and information is made public. Furthermore, it is experienced in “tragedies,” like Italy’s Years of Lead. The consequence of purely Western policy that I’d say could only be imagined by the unmatched talents of those types of individuals well attuned to the brutality unleashed by their forefathers throughout their colonial roots. It’s a cultural expression exposed to be unadulterated terrorist campaigns entirely manned and led by right-wing neo-fascist deathsquads, assets of the United States, and the key nations staffing NATO.

The second benefit is the allowances, granted by the hegemonic might of Europe's guard dog embodied in the United States, to wage and benefit from our neo-colonial wars of conquest against everyone else deemed fair game by the mere reality of not being born part of our select group of unbound privilege (but maybe not unbound any longer, god willing).

I know that sounds like a distinction without a difference, but I’m not talking about the bullshit, neoliberal, empty pandering we are accustomed too domestically. I’m talking about the sort of monstrous shit our white, billionaire, feudal lords feel they can openly brag about.

It’s the type of political power that gives President Emmanuel Macron the audacity to make insane claims about Russia being  'one of the last imperial colonial powers,’ to Africans, during his tour of the, more than 8, African nations France controls the national currencies and resources of.

It’s a sense of authority that allows American neo-fascist war criminals to, essentially, brag about and defend their murders on national TV. And continue to live out their, way too long, lives getting praised by the western foreign policy blob and media apparatus, who to deserve their day before a firing squad.

It’s the mentality that allows us to so cynically bemoan the injustices of nations like China when they’re shown to have the gall to start beating us at a game we rigged to never lose. We start screaming out for Democracy, and Human Rights, at our manufactured enemies while at the same time letting our closest ally, a human rights champion run the world's largest open-air prison on the population they are trying to genocide; one sniper shot in the face, or the knee, at a time.
