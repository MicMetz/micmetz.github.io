<IntroParagraph >
Our purpose for forming societies-and later on large governments-was to withstand threats and solve challenges that no individual can do on their own. Now, instead of comprising groups to ward off
predators trying to devour children in the night, we establish committees to hold companies like Facebook responsible for the negative effects of their products. A parent is not going to be capable
of self-conducting all the necessary research into every single corporate product their child engages with. Worse yet, with many of these platforms obfuscating the foundational structure their
products are built on Black boxing, it's unrealistic to expect anyone to be able to do so.
