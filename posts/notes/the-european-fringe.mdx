<IntroParagraph >
  Europeans are the type of people to insist Americans are backwards thinking when it comes to the classic hierarchical conservative racism, while at the same time are capable of being the type to
  call you a <q >n**er,</q> by a whole string of slurs the world has never heard uttered since the 19th century.
</IntroParagraph >


America is extreme when it comes to the normality of white resentment politics, but Europe is the type of place where you can be openly white supremacist and still maintain a sizable portion of
your country's electorate, like we see with the AfD in Germany, and in Italy under PM Meloni's Brothers of Italy.

Judging by the reactions of the media class throughout Europe over the last 6 years, the continent is presently undergoing a reactionary resurgence, both politically and culturally. This wave of
anti-liberalism, I would guess, is causing those opposed to it to panic into thinking of the possibilities that a neo-fascist movement rises and takes hold of Europe; bring forth a new era of instability to the western world; therefore, shattering the hegemonic dominance the bloc has had over a world upheld by the US' economic and military might after WWII.

However, I would argue that the rise of neo-fascist in Europe is not a new unforeseen phenomenon, but rather a resurgence of a movement that has been dormant for decades, and nearly unavoidable due to the makeup of our society. I say this because I don't see the ideological project started by Mussolini, and championed by Hitler, as a unique one-off event, but rather a template strategy used by our post-feudal hierarchical systems to maintain a semblance of control over the masses while simultaneously continuing the exploitation and capital expansion the system requires to survive.

As the saying goes, <q >Fascism is simply Capitalism in decay.</q> And I think Europe, as well as the US, are presently in a state of decay. Our economic system is designed to prioritize the
maximization of profit over the well-being of the worker.

This is why I argue that although we have seen a rapid increase in technologies that, in theory, were supposed to alleviate the burden of labor while simultaneously increasing productivity, we in reality have only seen a reduction in the amount of laborers used to produce a given amount of goods, but those same labor demands appended to the labor required of a smaller force earning even less of the profits.

This consolidation of profit by the top of our hierarchical structure will inevitably start to peter out, as there is only so much wealth to be extracted from a given population while maintaining a somewhat stable regime, clear of the danger posed by social unrest.

Europe has handled this threat of revolt from the masses by implementing Social Democratic reforms to give the laboring class a fairer share of the wealth extracted from them in the form of a welfare state, which has been successful in keeping the masses pacified. However, this strategy has mainly been allowed due to the fact that the unfairness required of the system has been outsourced to a foreign workforce in the form of cheap labor, and even slave condition labor from the Third World.

Today, we are witnessing the west's global dominance weakening to competitors like China. As a consequence, Europe is losing its militarily hold on its foreign slave labor force, and the masses
are once more being made aware of the unfairness inherent to its systems as the forces of capital look to old avenues in order to generate profits. Which in this case means bringing the brutality and austerity used abroad back to be use at home.

As the public becomes more and more troubled by their worsening economic conditions under austerity measures, leaders will understandably start to look for scapegoats to blame for their problems. Under these conditions, and with their ideological goals somewhat aligned with the hierarchical forces inherent to capitalism, the rise of once niche neo-fascist parties will become more and more appealing as a method of control.

Using the classic fascist strategy of divide and conquer (otherize and exterminate), an outside threat will be used to unite the population against a foe other than the powers that govern. Any and
all minority groups that are easily distinguishable from the larger polity, brown and black refugees from America's war in the global south for example, will all but certainly be chosen first as they are the easiest to scapegoat.

However, as the threats are dealt with, the masses will not be left once again pacified, as their concerns will still remain, and so the cycle will repeat itself. Becoming a vicious death spiral, entrapping a self-devouring death cult based on a shrinking self-ascribed identity, hellbent on reclaiming a lost glory that in itself was nothing more than a fleeting facade.
