## About

(Redesign influenced by [this](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/) person)

This is my personal website, where I post my projects and other things I'm working on. It's built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and hosted
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Development

To run the site locally, clone the repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server. The site will be available at `localhost:3000`.
